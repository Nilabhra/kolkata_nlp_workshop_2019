Really nice much appreciable",positive
1927,"A nice place to hangout since it has both the ambiance and the right kind of food to go with it.
Service persons are quite prompt and well mannered. The food is a prepared with the right mixture of spices which instantly tickles your taste buds.
Crispy chili octopus was really a right choice to start the journey. Our other dishes were good enough with a slight exception of the ham steak with was a bit light.",positive

7426,I got shell of egg in the egg roll. as a result i could not eat that. egg fried rice was average. but i shall give them zero as they don't give proper attention in cooking.,negative

6662,"A decent, pocket friendly place that offers warm, tasty food at dirt cheap rates. Staff behavior is really good to start with. Quantity and quality of food are way better than what you would expect at such price point.
What we had: Butter nun, tandoori roti, butter tandoori roti, chili chicken and palak Paneer.
Butter nun:4/5
Chili chicken:4/5,tasty nevertheless!
Palak paneer:3/5,this one was a tad bit disappointing.
Tandoori roti, butter tandoori roti : 5/5. Perfect, warm and soft.
A place where you can drop by after all the pre pujo shopping spree.",negative

1312,"Haldiram, in the present time, is nothing but a overpriced snacks store. There is nothing that can set them apart from local shops selling puri, samosa, pakodas etc. There is only the clean and subtle decor of the interiors, which according to me doesn't amount to much when all the others factors speak so less of you. I would just hope they would revice their pricing in the near future.",negative

3927,"Located just beside Nagerbazar 202 bus stand, this place is very near to my house and a life saver for me on many occasions. Ordered and visited numerous times. This food joint basically a takeaway though they have sitting arrangement of 5-6 people. Tried almost everything. The chicken and egg hakka chowmin, moghlai paratha, dosa and chicken kasa are my favourites from this small eatery.",negative
3574,"Heard that their chinese is pretty good therefore I landed up here with my hunger pangs. Ambience is average with an open bar.
Ordered:
Mixed noodles-The mixed Hakka was 190/- bucks, well I think that is a bit too much for noodles even though it was having a good quantity of prawn and pork slices. A bit too oily with chunks of big chopped onions.
Tandoori chicken-Too bad an experience with the Mughlai dish. The chicken was not rightly marinated with spices, was a little dry and the most disappointing part being that it came with no mint chutney. When I asked them for it they gave me a bottle of chilly sauce, too noob for a foodie. The quantity was not good as well.
Although alcohol is cheap, this place is not worth 4stars. The staffs are not enough polite with the customers, instead they have some egoistic behaviour. Was really disappointed with my visit.",negative
330,"Went there to have with Bidisha Banerjee on a Wednesday late afternoon. The place seemed quite happening and the ambience was nice as well. However I think the music played there live was not that great. Coming to food n drinks, we ordered
1. Traffic Ultimate Nachos - Decent, have had better versions of nachos with dip
2. Pollo Cremoso - Loved this thin crust pizza and if I am going back to this place this will be one of the reasons.
3. Chipotle Barbeque Prawns - This was nice and very tasty
4. Shots - Funky Monk, lick my peach, kill me quick and kamikaze with flavours(4)and all of them were good.

All in all a nice place to visit with friends especially before 5 PM to get the Happy Hours pricing",positive
8478,"A lovely place for post work get togethers, small parties and celebrations. Food is good, alcohol is genuine and is close to the MRP price and the service is good enough to match up to the price point. The ambience is also neat and clean. I would definitely be back with my bunch!",positive
9641,"I tried Bihari Cuisine first time from Litti Express. Overall experience was amazing. They made fantastic Litti chokha. My recommendation is to try Litti chokha with ghee. I also ordered Chhichhora Pakoda tokri. Chatnis served with Pakoda arre worth of special mention. I would say that Pakoda was just above average by taste. Darbhanga Dahi kabab was delicious. Among dessert items, only 1 was available- Oye makhana. This item was just okayish. If you like kadak chai, then masala tea here is a must try. Must try item here is definitely Litti chokha with ghee. The restaurant is simply but nicely decorated. Staff are polite.",positive
6050,"I visited this place for the first time. For the first time i had a bit difficulty in understanding the menu, but once you patiently go through it, its very good !
Ordered pineapple magic. Drink arrived in a glass bottle, and i loved it in the very first sip.
The crunch of muesli, the fresh pineapples, i didnt realize that a juice could actually substitute a meal which generally comprises of carbs!
I am planning a month of carb detox. I would love to order shakes from here, so that i stay away from carbs ! 
They have games available which the pic shows. I left the place with a big smile. 
Definitely will visit/order again.",positive

10495,Ordered from them via the newly launched swiggy pop menu and they absolutely lived up to their reputation.It was a nicely packed and adequate in quantity for one person combo meal of veg wok tossed noodles and veg shezwan stir fry.The noodles were not too greasy and subtlely spiced.The stir fried vegiees yossed in schezwan sauce was the show stealer though.It had broccoli/capsicum/potato/babycorn and onions and was tossed in a not overtly spicy sauce and had added star anise and dry chilli added to the mix for flavour.The one star i'm deducting or rather am saving for my next tryst with noodle oddles food on my next visit or order from them.,positive

5745,"Has been to this place on soshti afternoon. It was crowded just like expected on Durga puja days. We waited for sometime and were sent to 4th floor. The ambience was pretty average.service was slow, might be due to the puja rush. We ordered chicken chopsuey, mix fried rice, schezwan chicken. Mixed fried rice and schezwan chicken was decent. The gravy with chopsuey was too sweet due to excess ketchup. Chopsuey was disappointing. Might be due to rush and bulk orders.",negative

If you are looking for beat in cheap this is the one of them in this location.",negative

7185,"Well this place is famous for pizza cones but i though of trying the pizza first! Tbh I prefer margharita pizza always so here I took that as well with double cheese and it tastes better than any others in the city.

10277,"Went there to spend time with friends after college! It's a bit in the interiors of Tangra and for that maybe it's a bit underrated. Ordered Chilli Pork, Chicken Wantons and Chilli Potato. The chilli pork was definitely the stealer. Lean meat tossed in chilli soya gravy! This place serves one of the best pork in the city definitely. The cantons were nice but i felt stuffing could have been more, to me it was more of wanton sheet than the stuffing that came into my mouth. The chilli potato was nice and crispy ! It's definitely one of the best places for pork lovers. So do try their pork dishes. All in all it's a nice place with good ambiance unlike other tangra places. Booze is a bit on the costlier side but that's why the crowd is selective. Would love to recommend this place.",positive
1477,I was here few days back with my friend. It was empty in the afternoon. The staffs were cordial and the ambience is perfect with comfortable sitting.We ordered Hand Tossed Big Chicken pizza along with Green Apple Mojito.

3190,"Yesterday me and my office colleagues went to this place after office. This was my first visit to this place and was quite disappointed with the experience. The entire restaurant was empty. They were not serving liquor . Only food items were available. We ordered mutton Patiala (the only good thing about the entire experience), dragon chicken, crispy chicken, mixed rice, schezuan chicken and garlic chicken.

9900,"The reason to rate this high is because of the pocket friendly price list of this joint along with their good quality food. I have had egg rolls,chicken rolls, dry chili chicken, drums of heaven and chicken lollipops on many occassions. We also had paratha and egg curry from them once and a plate of mix chowmin. all the items are reasonably priced and tastes good.

The decor is quirky, graffiti adorned the walls, ambience was classy & some B& W pictures of old calcutta made up a significant portion of the wall decor. In terms of food, we ordered crispy fried baby corn in starters. In main course, we ordered the chef's special sliced pork hong kong &the schzewan prawn fried rice. The rice was tasty, adequate helpings of prawn, coupled with veggies & egg, but the pork side dish turned out to be pretty bland for our taste though the meat was tender & well cooked. The portions were adequate for two. Price is affordable. Overall a good experience. Definitely recommended. Sandip Das",positive

Located in the famous food street ‘Dacres Lane’, Chittoda’s Suruchee is a small restaurant and serves many of the original dishes from the famous Chitto Babur Dokan and some additional items as well. My favourites from their menu are:

Chicken Bharta – a signature dish from the menu, must try. Goes well with rumali roti 👌👌👌👌👌
Chicken Stew – a non-spicy yet tasteful bowl of health. Papaya and the carrot pieces are perfectly cooked. The chicken piece is really soft and tender. Goes well with bread toast 👌👌👌👌👌
Chilli Fish 👌👌👌👌
Fish Diamond Fry – Even though the price is almost 1.5 times of the regular fish fry but I strongly recommend their fish diamond fry. One of the best in town.👌👌👌👌👌",positive

Coming to the food. The food is excellent, no complains here at all. Eveyone must try their garlic naan.

2. Fish finger: Bhekti fish prepared in careful way so that the tenderness and juicy nature stays intact. Served really hot.

3. Madira murgh: A bit of spocy one, this. Kebab preparation woth a hint of alcohol in it?

4. Crispy fish: My favorite from all. So much that I still crave for it right now.

We also took opportunity of the drinks section and enjoyed a lot. We had entered around 6.30 pm and got out around 11.30 pm. Staffs were throughout courteous and helping. Music was awesome and the ambiance was amazing to hang out with old friends.

It's a ramshackle street side joint with rickety and broken benches placed outside for seating while the little are roasted and grilled over a flame. The bite sized litti which are small wheat dumplings stuffed with sattu and then roasted/ grilled over the flame, the charred litti with the smokiness from the fire are served together with the potato chokha , which is basically mashed potatoes with chillies and mustard oil. Also served together with these is a green chutney/ dip....all three eaten combined...tastes heavenly.After having the litti have the amazingly prepared kesaria milk tea, just adjacent. The person who prepares it does it with a cool attitude/ desi swag!!

Its a very refreshing drink, specially in the summers. Another time i was here, i also ordered the bacon-wrapped chicken. The chicken was soft and the sauce they serve with it,takes the dish to a whole new level. The staff was courteous and helpful. The ambience deserves a special mention.

This place had a further downgrade in staff quality too. Chaos prevailed with staff not competent enough.

Starters: Chicken Tandoori - pieces were not soft. Tasted average.

Mains: Mutton Biriyani - Mutton Pieces were very hard. Taste of the Biriyani was better than the Mutton itself.

Chicken Bharta - Nothing extraordinary.

We ordered:
☑️ Bhaji Pav Mastaani
☑️ Madh Island

Pav bhaji was so good and tasty. But i believe the pav could be more soft. The dessert was impressive and looked fancy. The serving of the chocolate sauce could also me more generous though. Satisfying food nonetheless.

Since I'm a 'no alcohol' person so Starting with mocktails-
I have had A pink paradise mojito and Gentle breeze.
I totally loved both of them, pink paradise mojito was more soury than gentle breeze and gentle breeze was sweet soury drink.. both pleasing to taste buds.

Food -
For food I started with Non veg sliders and was absolutely in love with it.. the chicken slider could have been more spicy but the sauce provided made up for it . 3 sliDers for that price was pretty much affordable.

Next I had two in one pizza which was Chefs special and I have to say I liked notHing about the pizza.. it was not the best pizza I have had. It was like nachos topped with cheese and a little non veg toppings and that's it. Not recommended.

Recommendation overall -3.8

• Veg sandwich
The raj kachori was really tasty and recommended from my side. For the cheese paw bhaji, the cheese was only grated over the bhaji, not even melted. So go for the normal paw bhaji instead. The chole bhature was not great. The taste of the chole was not at all tasty. And lastly, the veg sandwich was okayish.

Pan Fried Chili Fish - It was really tasty. And quantity was really good. But the actual fish had an excess of batter and all the pieces were stuck together when it arrived. But overall tastewise it was very good. 

Pan fried Chicken Momo - Really good sizes, and a very tasty gravy. But the filling was ""bakwas"". I could find a lot of onion, very little chicken. The filling had a almost no seasoning. The momos had a very thick skin. If the owner is reading this, I would suggest them to reduce the size of the momo, and finely chop the fillings so that they can use a thinner momo skin.

Mutton adrak ke panje, Murg lasuni kebab and Kabuli Nan (a sweet nan with peanuts) which are their signature dishes and must try. Apart from these you can also try the mutton biryani, dal makhani, palak corn/paneer, saag meat and chicken tandoori butter masala.",positive

The fish Kabiraji was delicious. It was served with chips and made for the English equivalent of fish and chips xD. Anyways, it was a friend covering stuffed with fish and egg. It was very soft and moreover very reasonable. The fish curry and rice combo wasn't something remarkable. It was just okay. The service was quick but the behavior was just mediocre.

7701,"Undoubtedly, the premises of ecovista is very closely located to the IT hub and the newly developing Newtown, it has an edge over many others; however I was surprised that it’s a place that will probably do well only during brunch or lunch hours mainly by corporate guests or the likes and dinners are usually not full as also suggested by the staff. On a weekend evening, the place is deserted, in fact in dark if you are new to the place, you won’t be able to locate the restaurant as well. 

Somehow we did manage to get there and it was pin drop silent both in and outside. We were there for an hour and yet no movement. Insanely quiet and secluded it seemed on a Sunday evening. The food was average and service was equally average too. Not a place for family dinner over weekends. Daytime atleast the area in itself is bustling.

I am sure the original restaurant in the Conclave in central Kolkata still works better and rightly so.",negative
3888,"Naariyal Pani goes by its name to provide the authentic South Indian food with a western touch. The ambiance, the theme and the menu sparks the flavours of South India. They begin with their classic chaas(butter milk) that will bowl you over with it's rich taste.

However, some dishes seem overpriced, for instance, 'Jalebi Caviar' that only has three spoons of serving that doesn't match the price. The innovation with some of the other dishes like 'Bubble Dosa' is good and worth appreciating.
'Shotgun Murgan Idly' has less of podi masala and tasted like any ordinary idly. Clearly, it doesn't fit the bill.

Well, according to us, with their present concept, the entire offering and experience could have been better.",negative

Coming to the food ordered. I have ordered quite a lot of food from this particular joint. However, my personal favourite is the choupsey and lastly I had this Chinese choupsey and honestly it did stood out. Loved it.

Edit 1: Had ordered Chicken Honey Lemon. Along with veg fried rice. The lemon in the honey lemon was so intense that the entire portion tasted bitter. Also, the packing was so bad that the entire gravy was in the plastic. Very bad experience this time. Reducing my rating from 4 to 3.

Few days ago, I asked for home delivery Tandoori Roti and Schezwan Paneer via calling. Mr. Abhijeet assured me that the delivery will be there within 25 mins approx. The delivery boy confirmed my address 10 mins later, on the way. He reached there within the time.

Frankly, It was an amazing preparation. Nothing more, nothing less: just a proper dish. I really loved it. More than that they have set up an affordable price. No extra charges.",negative
4880,"Well I don’t know if the quantity of the mixed noodles was less because it was in the offer or not. 
But talking about the quality of the food, I loved it. The amount of chicken, egg, prawn used was very much sufficient for one noodle. The smell of Chinese dwelled in the noodles. I’ll surely give a second try to the restaurant.. (: ❤️",positive
1771,"Ordered Veg Biriyani, Kadhai Paneer and Tandoori Roti via Swiggy. The Biriyani was good in taste as well as quantity. The Paneer was also good but the Tandoori Roti disappointed me. It was a bit over-cooked. Will surely order again in future! :)",positive

7610,"A small joint near Tapan Theatre Hall (33, Sadananda Road) that serves Gourmet Burgers 🍔 and Fries 🍟. Ordered through Swiggy.

Though I am not a big burger fan except for some specific American joints, this burger turned out as a BLISS.

Mountain Clegane Beef Burger - Three moist pieces of beef patties, bacon 🥓, chicken sausages, fresh garlic mayo, good quality cheddar cheese, mild sweet pickle, lettuce and grilled onions. The quality of the bread 🥖 was up to the mark. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

P.s: Ordered other fried baked items, but they did not meet my expectation.

23,"Visited recently with friends for lunch buffet on a weekday. The ambience is just awesome. The best time to visit is around 1p.m., if you want to avoid the crowd. They have so much to offer in lunch buffet, the spread is huge. They have live counters where you can order pasta, spaghetti, chaats and they deliver it to your table. There's always a host to cater to your needs.The vegatable biryani deserves a special mention amongst all the dishes. Only, the other veg dishes have much room for improvement as per the taste. But then they make it up with their dessert spread. I must say, the desserts offered here are absolutely one of its kind. They have got cakes, pastries, pudding, tarts, cheesecakes, mousse; you name it. I seriously feel they should have a seperate buffet for desserts only. 😉 Next time I visit, it's going to be exclusively for desserts.",positive
6283,"I am a self-confessed cheese lover and wanted to visit this place ever since I read about it. Jojo (Arjun) and I dropped in on a weekday evening. The location is right beside the Woodburn Street CCD. It is just a small room on the ground floor done up in pastel pink with Instagram-friendly decor. We ordered the cheesy nachos, some cold coffee and the jalapeno and cheese stuffed chicken poppers. I was very disappointed with the quantity of cheese both in the nachos and in the chicken balls. The coffee was decent. Apparently their pizzas and pastas are loaded with cheese but does one have to be cheese deprived for the starters? Expected better!",negative

For dessert we took Shahi Tukda and Firni.
The best one was the kebab no doubt- extremely juicy and melt in your mouth. We also loved the Shahi tukda it was very light. We have had biryani as take away plenty of times before, so nothing new to add other than as usual, they maintained their standard of aromatic biryani rice and flavorful mixtures!",positive

•Mixed Noodles - Average in taste. Good quantity for two people and ample amount of sliced chicken and eggs.

•Veg Fried Momo - Disappointed by the taste of momos as well as the chutney. The chutney could have been a little more spicy and the stuffing could have been enhanced.

There are jewelleries and clothes displayed for sale. Spacious enough with cosy seats and and courteous staffs. Overall a good experience.",negative
4033,"Had been to this place with a friend of mine. This place is completely out of its domain. Sitting beside some of the best restaurants, this place managed to serve old and stinky food which was neither changed nor excluded from the bill. Going by the price, the food is not worth the price to be paid. The staff are nice but in the end, its a restaurant and its the food that should impress, but this place failed to do so. One suggestion to the people having food from this place is that never try the chicken biryani combo.",negative

We had the chicken sweet corn soup which was full of chicken chunks followed by fish finger. The crust of the fish fingers were crunchy and the fish tasty.
For main course we asked for their house special, which is veg pulao and chicken kosha. I can safely say that had one of the best veg pulao and chicken kosha in a long long time. They also deliver.

Aloo nazakat- it is basically a stuffed potato but taste is good but not so much interesting

Ordered food from this place after many years thinking that it has improved itself but it's still the same. It still lacks quality and taste.
Ordered mixed Hakka chowmein and chilli pork.
The chowmein was excessively oily. Tasted okayish.
While, the chilli pork was sheer disappointment. Never ever had pork slices batter fried and tossed in gravy anywhere else! Pork slices are never fried, they are roasted and then added to the sauce/gravy. That's the essence of chilli pork. But this one was nothing like that. In addition, the gravy was super salty and tasteless. Such waste of money!",negative

The seats are shabby, reminding of 2nd class railway waiting rooms decades back. The music as well as the waiters are loud, shouting to each other in the vernacular....not a place to catch up on some peace of mind.
Right now the bar remains closed from 2300 to 1000hrs but grapevine says it's soon going to be open 24hrs. Hope the facility gets a facelift by then.
By the way, the food is at best average....no cocktails and no premium brands of your favourite 'poison' available!!",negative

Two are enough for 1 person with moderate appetite. Kadai veg was nice. It had paneer, grated carrots and capsicum in it mainly. Generally the dish is spicy. However they customised it for us so ours was moderately spicy. Paneer butter masala was average. It was sweet in taste so I didn't like much. Kadai murgh was fine though I didn't like the chicken pieces which weren't tender. The ambience is nice. This restaurant, unlike others in the same area, is quite spacious so you can easily hang out with your large group. The service is very slow however. They took at least 30-40 minutes to serve.

Pros: Delicious momos, serves pork, pocket friendly.
Cons: Bad decor, moderate service pace.

They serve mainly chinese Cantonese and Schezwan (or Sichuan) dishes, so pork is available here unlike any other chinese joints in Kolkata.

Tried their Pork fried and veg fried momo. Both were absolutely delicious. Loved em. Apart from momos they also has Noodles/Chowmein, soups, stir friedds, chop suey etc.

The decor is nothing to fancy, but a piece of Old Calcutta interior, with high ceiling and brown tables and chairs. Very nostalgic in a way

The service was moderate, the waiters don't attend you often, but just takes the order fast and leaves.

All in all i loved it..and is recently planning to pay them a second visit.

The soup was enough for four people. We had taken the Wanton Soup. We had also taken, chicken fried rice, chicken chowmein, fish in Hamei Sauce and Chicken Salt Pepper.
We had taken the fish seeing the reviews but we didn't quite like the taste. People loving the taste of raw fish will love it.
The rice and chowmein were surely much more than the price we paid for it.

4732,"Let's be frank, I would rate it 2.5 out of 5 but no option for that on new Zomato app. I ordered recently from them via Zomato, and it was delivered quite fast at Nagerbazar.

Now coming to food, the packaging was not definitely great as you can see from the picture. Guys you need to spend a bit for brand recognition. The packaging was like it's from a local streetside shop.

I ordered their special sharmawa chicken sandwich - that tasted good but it's better that you don't order it at home, rather have it in the shop. The warm got lost, and I don't blame on them. The fish butterfly is too oily, and the kasundi was quite bitter in taste. However the mixed haka chowmin was better to tastebud, but it contains only chicken & egg, no prawn with it. It's quite dry and simple tomato sauce would not make a justice to its dryness. I would order a Chinese main course with it.

The scope of improvements are there, and I hope they will!",negative

Chelo kebab was good but could have been better. The chicken stroganoff with buttered rice tasted great. I loved the european dish. But the quantity of rice must be increased I feel.
Next is the murg biriyani with an awesome raita...loved it... really different in taste...the chicken pieces were medium sized and about 8 in quantity.

Quantity was okk for a single tummy. Packaging was good. Also Delivered within the said time.

Edit 1- Had the chilly tandoori kebab from here on the offer of snacks@39. It was too hot. And the chicken legs were quite soft, tender and juicy. All-over , it was quite spicy and tasty at the same time. I loved it. And I will love to have it again.",negative

Among the dishes ordered, Murgh Potli kabab will certainly fill you up very quickly although the stuffed balls of goodies seemed bland to me. The gosht Chapli kabab however on the other end was a bit too loud. As per several food blogs I can say Chapli kababs are supposed to hit you taste buds with unapologetic pleothra of raw spices. But I was expecting better balance overall. We were so filled up after the starter course, that we went for simple butter naan and chicken butter masala. Both of those were amazing.

Most of the drinks and starters cost above 99rs. 75% items from the menu cost (49+99 & 59+99) Is this really a 99 offer.
We ordered
✔️ Breezer ( Jamaican passion)
✔️ Beer ( Kingfisher)
✔️ Murgh tikka kebab(4 pcs for 160rs)
They served popcorn with the drinks which was not good in taste. They charged 538rs(including tax).
The ambience is not upto the mark. There is also a dance floor. Hookah is available there. Even the leather couches have so many tears.

When we asked for hot rice - they brought not so warm rice & as we said this is not hot enough - they said this is the most they could do.

934,"Mitra cafe can be considered less of a cafe and more of a cabin. If you're a non veg lover and are near any outlet of this cafe, do not forget to hop in and enjoy the juicy fish fries. The fish butter fry literally melts in the mouth giving you a feeling of utter satisfaction. Fish kabiraji is definitely their speciality,but you can also try out other dishes on the menu. The place also makes sure that the cost of the dishes doesn't make a hole in the customer's pocket.",positive
5756,An old restaurant with no change over the years. The food is very average. Not much great. However the quantity is brilliant and justifies the price.,negative
2657,"Where to start and stop?! The service, food.. Insanely good! One bite and you can feel even the quality of oil used! Non greasy, easy on stomach food! Astounding part was serving kimchi with crispy fried babycorn. For main course we had pulao, kosha mangsho and kadai paneer and butter naan. Each of them spectacular!
The only drawback for the restaurant is it's location. Situated in a bit interior, far away from the crowds of Rajarhat roads. However, this acted as boon for us since this was the only restaurant where we secured a seat without hassle during durga puja.",positive
6679,"I have been visiting China Town with my family for over a decade now, or even more. Everything might change but the love for authentic Chinese food served here is constant. This is a family favourite. They have maintained quality and quantity over the years. Today we had Shanghai Veg Hakka noodles and paneer pakoda. 3 of us and we couldn't finish the massive bowl of noodles. The ambience is good and the service is prompt.",positive
2527,"Comparing Eden pavilion to other ITC pavilions and buffet lounges, the quality might not be as high compared to its other counterparts, however is still one of the better buffet options and the second best price value in my opinion in Kolkata. 

The best part about their spreads that I personally enjoy the most are the salads and appetizers section as over the last few visits, the main course however has been dissapointing a little with poor choices of curries and the simple lack of exotic dishes to accompany along with the biryani. Over time Eden pavilion I think needs to improve the choices for the main course which would really be a boost for them. 

Service and ambiance on the other hand has always been good and comfortable to dine alongside to and hopefully will be for the near future. Definitely recommend any first timers considering to visit. A bit heavy on the pockets though!",positive
1438,"A very warm & cozy cafe serves some awesome coffee and munching bits. Went on a peaceful evening and had a great time. Food was on point and so was the service. However this was my second visit..on my first visit I was surprised by a live stand up comedy show which was really entertaining!!

They also have a snug corner..which gives you to sit privately with your group of friends and enjoy your time.

Personal favourite- Broccoli soup & Nutella crepe",positive

The book shelves have an assortment of books which you can buy at a reduced price. The seating is quite comfortable and you have lots of games available. We ordered the cafe latte, vanilla cappuccino, regular cappuccino. They served the coffee with yummy cookies. The french fries were delicious with the right amount of salt, which was balanced by the honey mustard dip. The chicken pesto pasta was so creamy and melted in the mouth. We tried the Halloween special chicken paprika dish with herb rice. Out of all the dishes, this one disappointed. The staff was courteous and service was prompt.

1299,We had went there out of no choice since everything around us was closed. Now when we went there we were made to sit in the restaurant area which was fine by us because we were just hungry and not interested to party . We ordered and the order came sooo late. I thought we were going to doze off. Meanwhile when we were waiting a couple came in and started fighting. The problem is crowd was extremely cheap and drunk. Had the worst experience ever . And the food was not good also. First and last visit.,negative

Each and every dish is perfectly good. Sweet & sour fish has a flavorful sauce and tasted good but not too good. Fish in oyester sauce was juicy and succulent with an amazing sauce, one of the best I have ever had. This is a must try dish here. They also have a huge variety of good food. Overall, a great experience from Spicy treat. And will be definitely trying it's other menu as well.",positive
3121,Well the experience satisfactory I would say. The aftermath was not so welcoming. Meaning when we had the food it tasted good but after few hours all our family members suffered from acidity . I don't know what was in the food that caused this. The service and food is fantastic when we were in the restaurant but after some time things started to change. The total bill 1691 so you can imagine we had quite a lot . Attaching the bill in the photo section since taking pictures of so many things had not been possible. Some of the members of family said it was due to the excess oil that was in the mixed fried rice .we did not tell the restaurant at that point of time because all was super hungry at that point of time and you all know when you are hungry anything that is before you tastes heaven. Please improve the food quality from next time .,negative
38,Well had been to this place a while back to attend an event. Really loved the banquet space on offer. The open area is a real show stopper. The food is good here. The starters on offer are pretty innovative and tasty. Really enjoyed the mini pizzas and fried chicken ala Kiev though it wasn't really the dish. Simply fried chicken with a tangy dip anyhow does the trick. The Dal makhni tart was innovate. However the Dal makes the casings soft and kills the fun. Food is decent here. Liked the chicken mughlai dish on offer. Need to work on their fish dishes.they use basa which is a tastless fish basically. needs stronger flavours to tingle the palate.,negative
324,"The best place for cheapest and best drinks in Kolkata. During happy hours, the rates of drinks are very pocket friendly. The ambience is good but due to less space, this place is a bit crowdy.
Let's talk about the food now. The food was good, it tasted good. We order barbeque chicken. We specially went there for drinks. Had around 4-5 rounds of drinks. The first round was normal drinks, like Smirnoff, old monk, honey bee etc and the other round was for shots. Among the shots, Kamikaze stole the show. Had a nice experience here, hope to visit there soon, again.",positive
5336,"Ordered Veg chowmien from here. It was not up to the mark. Taste was bland, only black pepper was sprinkled and too less veggies. It seemed it was made very long back and warmed up and packed. Will not order again.

Edit 1: Visted the place with the friend for a quick catch up and ordered Veg schezwan noodles and white sauce pasta along with fresh lime soda and masala cold drink. Schezwan noodles were so spicy that I couldn't eat more than 3 spoons. Surprisingly pasta was really good and creamy. The drinks did not have apt amount of soda and felt more like a flavored water and sugar drink. So again, only recommend pasta, nothing else.",negative
8748,"Finally visited this place after passing it by several times and never having the time before.
Got a take out of Chicken fried - egg - cheese burger and a chicken wrap. Both were tasty, though the presentation could be improved.

1611,One of the oldest restaurants located at park street which is known for its live music and food.This time we happenned to stumble upon Trincas during Durga puja. We ordered quite a few starters and some moctails to start the lunch. This place seemed a lil pricey when compared to the taste.

Can't recall how many times I have visited this place. I would recommend the continental dishes over here and not the Indian ones. However, the continental kitchen remains closed during Durga Puja time. The staff are pretty friendly. My personal favorite over here is the Baked Fish. I prefer the one without tomato. The turkey preparations during the Christmas season are also pretty good. The ground floor is for family. If you are with friends, you can opt for the first floor, however the first floor is a bit shabby and the ceiling is pretty low!!! However, this will always be one of my favorite places.",positive

Sizzling brownie and a mousse in desert.

The decor is brilliant, the seats are very comfy and spacious. There is a huge tv set if people love to enjoy food and games together. The service guys were very polite and courteous.

Coming to the food. They will give a complimentary papad and chutney. We had galouti kebab and a chiken kebab for starters. The chicken one was brilliant and you can ask the service guys for the same. In main course we ordered hyderabadi biriyani and keema biriyani. Needless to say, they were 2 tasty. The standout though was chicken rara. Just go for it.

I will recommend this place to all and will surely visit again.",positive

3080,"Visited Golden Dragon on Vijaya Dashami evening on a friend's insistence. Despite having a rating of 3.8 on Zomato, my experience at this place was not satisfactory.

We ordered:
Fresh Lime Soda
Spring Chicken Boneless - 8 medium sized pieces, crunchy outside, but not soft enough inside. Did not like it much.
Mixed Gravy Noodles - Quantity was enough for two, but taste was not upto the mark. I've had much better within the same price range elsewhere. Furthermore, they had given only four pieces of prawns in an entire plate of noodles and those too did not seem to be very fresh.
Chilli Roast Pork - I did not taste this one but the ones who did said that it tasted well.

Ambience was average. The washroom side was not very clean. Service was so-so. Waiters seemed reluctant to serve despite the place being empty.
Overall, even though the place is pocket-friendly, given the ample number of good restaurants in the area, I doubt if I would be ever visiting it again.",negative

I don't know if it was because we were the first (and only) diners at that point of time, but the service was extremely prompt and thoughtful. I forget when I had had a softer, more succulent Tandoori Chicken than this and the Naan, more supple and cushiony. The Bharta too was delicious, but somewhat overshadowed by its awesome companions.

*Everyone who works in the outlet behaves very good,the only negative thing is even a small order will make you wait for 20-25minutes,so if you drop in for a quick bite with no time in hand, think again.
*My favorite one in this outlet are Egg Burger and Potato Burger,both at Rs.30,as they fill up my tummy whenever I am in for a quick bite and don't have enough money to spend, plus it tastes amazing!

*IMPORTANT THING- PROPER DISPOSAL,PROPER FACILITY TO WASH HANDS AFTER EATING AND WIPING TISSUES, WATER AVAILABLE FOR DRINKING WHICH IS PURIFIED.CLEAN WORKING ENVIRONMENT AND CLEAN CUSTOMER SEATING ENVIRONMENT,PROPER VENTILATION.",negative

I came to know it is a place by famous Bollywood singer Kumar sanu and the place certainly shows that, also I really liked the Bollywood theme it has. Some of the posters here are really quirky and I loved all of it. It reminded me of all the Bollywood films I have grown up watching. The place is spacious and the food here is something that impressed me the most, yes here and there a few changes can be made in service but it is a nice place to be.

They also have an unusual menu, so we asked our waiter for recommendations. Chicken chimichuri and Fresh water bekti pan fried. For drinks we went with their Bourbon LIIT and scotch. The LIIT was well prepared and heady. As forvthe food the chicken was really good and worth another try, not too spicy yet the right amount and juicy. The fish tasted delicious but with the veggies and pan frying ot wasn't something I'll order again.",positive

✔Schezwan Fried Rice (Mixed)
✔Chicken Manchurian

The staffs are quite good, one of them suggested us to decide our side dish, as the one we ordered will not go with it he said. But the service was not up to the mark. It took them to serve the order almost 25 minutes late, after the order being made.

Hardly 10 people can sit at a time. But if you talking about the food-  it was good. The quantity was very good. We ordered one plate of crispy fried chicken, one egg chicken fried rice and garlic chicken in gravy. The quantity was so good that we couldn't finish one plate rice in one go. The crispy chicken was so good. The garlic chicken also good but the cornflour coating could be little thinner. So overall food and service was good.

Now coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Schezuan Chicken. It tasted nice both the dishes were simple but nice.
The only thing which I can conclude that it is overpriced. And not 500 for two at all.
It costs just similar to some exclusive Chinese restaurant but compare to their quality and quantity it is behind. So it is not less expensive at all. But food is good so you can go and try once.",negative

I have ordered crispy chili babycorn and a veg chinese combo( veg fried rice & Veg manchurian 4pcs. ). The taste of babycorn is very average and it was not at all crispy. When i got the order it's already cold maybe for that reason it doesn't taste that much good. Veg fried rice is totally ok but the veg manchurian balls are so hard that it cannot be cutted with spoon. The size was also very small. Portion size of both the items is good. The combo is sufficient for one person but need to improve the side dishes.

Chicken Hakka Noodles were of thick quality, well mixed with veggies & spices. Bit hot due to use of chopped green chillies. Overall okey to taste.

Chicken Manchurian gravy was thick & saucy. It was full with garlic & spring onion that actually enhanced its flavour. Chicken pieces were bit small but overall it tasted nice.

There isn't much cheap options available for filling chinese food in Avani food court. While this is the only option, their food is quite okey to try & it tastes good too.",negative

Upto this it was still accept able then we ordered another chicken starter but did not like it. Then we went for main course we ordered Chinese chopsuey it was again disaster then as a side dish we asked for a fish dish but they served it in chicken when we again complained they offered to change the dish to fish but by then we have had enough we told them to cancel asked for the check and left. It was highly disappointing.,negative

9319,"We had booked a table in advance over here but still had to wait for 1.5 hrs to get a seat. The waiters were all flustered and showed lack of training in handling such a large group as ours (we were a group of 26 people). The service in the beginning was pathetic. Water was served in mismatched glasses. Tablespoon was given with soup. Starter plates weren't served to most while one member received a plate with chipped corners. 
But what was recommendable over here is the food. In starters, we had ordered crispy chana n lasagne. Both were excellent items, though i found the tomato in the lasagne a bit too overpowering. 
Naan n kulcha tasted good. Paneer was a disappointment. Daal makhni was great. Methi matar malai tasted bland n most of the people in our group didn't like it. 
Overall a good experience overshadowed by the frustration of waiting excessively in the beginning. May visit again with family.",negative

The insides are surprisingly clean with old style stone top tables and wooden chairs (very similar to Paramount in College Street). Though the place is rather small. If you prefer you could order takeaway. The place is legendary among northern locals in our city. Must try items, and very famous, include their Chicken Stu (not STEW!) and Fish Fingers and Fish Roll. They have expanded the menu in recent years which is nicely pasted on the wall inside. They don't refrigerate raw materials which is a huge relief under the current situation. Anyway, we've been having their food for a long time and never been sick. I would rate them higher but the staff can be a bit aloof at times.",negative

2354,"Basically this restaurant is serving authentic bengali food. Ambiance of this restaurant is really awesome and I just felt like I am feeling the vibes of old Calcutta. Also they are very much hygienic. Calcutta pi is a new restaurant which is located at near Jadavpur thana and easy to locate. Let's come to the menu we tried here -

Gondhoraj Ghol
Chanar chop
Fish Fry
Dhokar Dalna
Bhetki Paturi
Daab Chingri
Murgi Daakbanglow
Basanti Pulao
Mutton Kasa
Kheer luchi
Malpua with Kheer

Personally I loved their food . All dishes were tasty and delicious. The fish fry was so big and tasty and had a smooth texture. Gondhoraj ghol had essence of Gondhoraj lebu. Bhetki paturi was average. Now let's come to my favourite food which is daab chingri and it was really awesome. The prawns are so big and tasty. They've cooked it in a very well manner which I liked the most. Rest of the dishes were tremendously awesome. You people should visit this place for an awesome experience.

I think the offer is pretty good for two people finding some leisure time over here.
Nachos were great. We had mango delight and Shirley Temple in mocktails. Shirley Temple was really awesome and quite refreshing with a little tangy and sweet taste. The hookah is decent, I won't say it would be something I would buy without such discounts or offers.
This place is well decorated. But the service is a big turn off as it is really really slow. Had to sit for 40 mins for this!

Galauti was mouth melting and i will provide 5 out of 5 for this one. But for the first time i saw boti and pasanda kebab in a semi gravy. It tasted really good with tawa paratha and i think the gravy serves the purpose well. Main course was Shahi mutton biryani and chicken rezala. Both were super light. Rezala gravy was runny, chicken was good. Mutton pieces of biryani was very much succulent and the rice was of long grain and did not contained oil ghee or dalda, it was amazingly light and super healthy. But i will recommend galauti and paratha the most. Will try other items next time and provide review.",positive

The place is very basic with small tables and no frills but focuses on the small menu it has and good food.

What I ordered:

-Addai Dosa : dosa is wafer thin and hence did not enjoy though taste was good

-Appam : very well made (🌟 Dish)

- Chicken Kozhi Chicken : I think the spices were definitely lacking.

-Chicken Ghee Roast : well sone dish. The meat came off pretty easy and was tasty as well.

After 15 years I came to Kolkata as a tourist and definitely ate Biryani from here . 
Little disappointed with the quantity and quality. I dont know which oil they use but it's too sticky something that doesn't happen when I eat Hyderabadi or Lucknowi Dum Biriyani at my Mumbai. 
Anyway the Biryani was tasty and I hope next time I won't feel any sort disappointment.",positive

All you can smell is the gondhoraaj lebu, no taste of fish! It tasted sweet and sour, I didn't like it at all!! You won't get any taste of the fish! I think it was total waste of money, I could hardly eat it!",negative
10384,"Had this place booked for 30 people, for a family ocassion. The food is not as bad as their service. The service was worst. There was just one guy serving to 30 people sitting for lunch. And people were waiting for the next serve for 20 mins for next dish. This was a big let down for my family in front of our guests. There should have been more staff for serving food also the kitchen should have be quick to pass on the dishes so even the one waiter was not sitting idle when people were asking for the next item when they were done eating what was on their plate. Hence these people are unprofessional and it will be dicy to go to this place for anyone. Put your money where there is worth, this place is just not to visit again. Mind you this place is cheap for a reason, they are just too casual when it comes to a good banquet hall or a restaurant.",negative

The best part about the rolls these people make is that they are very light on the stomach. You can have one of their chicken rolls and walk a mile, it's so light and non oily. The taste is not compromised either. The chicken pieces have a subtle smoked flavor and once wrapped up in those soft parathas,appeal brilliantly to one's taste buds. Recommended!",positive

Veg Tandoori Platter @ 10 Downing Street, Sec V - Salt Lake ☺

It was a lavish platter comprising of 6 vegetarian tandoori kebab preparations, a side salad and green chutney.

The kebabs were - Hara Bhara Kebab, Makhmali Seekh Kebab, Tandoori Bharwan Aloo, Paneer Achari Tikka along with it's creamier and less spicy version aka Paneer Tikka and spicy marinated tandoor cooked cauliflower florets.

All the kebabs tasted nice, barring the cauliflower one.

Situated in a very strategic location right at the junction of Bangur, a small place with few seats but the menu is very innovative and the food is extremely delicious. Ideal place for a group of friends to catch up for a chat or maybe a couple of school/college dating kids catching up for a pocket friendly snack.

7667,"A friendly restaurant in my neighbourhood, that has been there since my school going days. A small place that can seat around 25 people approx. The food is quite good. They come in decent proportions . The taste is of fantastic bengali- chinese. Being a Bengali, I totally find this type of Chinese taste amazing. We had chicken soups, crispy prawn, fried rice, hakka chowmin, chilli chicken and sweet and sour prawn. Fresh lime soda was too good. The desserts were brownie with chocolate sauce and butterscotch ice cream. All the dishes were good. The sweet and sour chicken was fantastic. Crispy prawns were a bit over fried... It could be improved.

The service was mention worthy. The person who served our table was very polite, amicable and had the perfect atitude.

Only minus is the space crunch.. The mazzenine low ceiling floor is a bit crampy. I wish they expand the restaurant to accommodate more people.

Id definitely like to revisit Again soon",positive

The appam with potato stew, mutton olathede and kerala cohzi curry stole the show. We also ordered paratha but trust me the mutton was so soft it just melted in my mouth. Special note : mutton was spicy but mouthwatering. The only negative point was that the amount was less and not sufficient for more than three people. However, it was pocket friendly and will return very very soon with friends and family.",positive
1756,"I love Blue poppy.. so decided to try this place since it is in the same compound. Doma Wang is a popular name when it comes to tibetan and nepali food. The ambiance is quite good with traditional floor seating also. We went for their signature open momos. Visually very attractive but tastewise like normal momos only being less juicy. Pricing is also high for a plate of 10piece small sized momos it is 250 bucks. Nonetheless, we tried their Pork Thakali set which was very average and can be easily given a miss. I only liked the spicy dum aloo in the platter. The pork was blamd and no flavours. Overall an average experience",negative

Cheese Cigaar : love the plating and dip but Cigaar was so so.

In Drinks :
Tangy Sunrise : Love the quantity as it was a size of a Pitcher. If you love tangy twist then go for it.

However, if spending good time is your motive,den a little compromise on the price part can be considered. I have been there a couple of times but the timings are completely awkward. Maybe 4 in the morning or 11 in the breakfast. The food is also good especially the starters. Park is known for attracting young crowds and so it does lives upto the expectations always.",positive
2782,"Being a localite of sodepur, I will surely consider this place as a really nice restaurant to visit near kanchkol and amarabati. I visited this place on Christmas day for lunch with family. They were in the middle of their decoration that time. But very well they managed us to sit at one side where my family won't get disturbed. The staff suggested to choose chicken tart as starter as that was special item on Christmas day, which turned truly a nice choice. We also tried cream of chicken soup, chicken hakka noodles and chilly fish. Quanity was enough and budget friendly. The staff are courteous and friendly. Service was good. They also informed that they don't use food colors and ajinamoto in their food.",positive

Food quantity was more than enough for 2 persons. Now come to the taste , all food were piping hot .Loved the moonv daal with jhuri aloo bhaja combo.prawn was stale and we suspect that it was not fresh. The crab tasted good though. But it lacks heat and is a little to sweet. Not complaining though.keep up the good work.thumbs up.",positive

4048,"This was my first venture to any food joint serving proper Oriya cuisine. The restaurant is themed with Oriya films and sitting arrangement is pretty decent.
I had opted for mutton thali which had arrived pretty quick, courtesy to their good staffs and management. The thali came with plain rice, dal, a vegetable dish and obviously mutton. All three pieces of mutton were well cooked, soft and tasty. The price was 200 bucks for the thali which has been properly justified by the quality and quantity of the food.
Will like to visit again!!",positive

2095,"One of the best hangout joint in Salt Lake area! A very cheerful cafe where you can enjoy not only delightful food but also chill with your friends over hooka! The best part is that they have created a small different section for hooka so that not everyone is disturbed if they don't enjoy it!! I personally loved the book section..and this would be a sound place to enjoy a book over a coffee.

They also have live bands during weekend..however I haven't got a chance to be part of it. Also currently they were selling second hand books..which I found to be really interesting.

Personal favourite: Broccoli soup (Must try!!)",positive
6501,"So here we’re at The Bengal Hotel. After watching a movie, he and I decided to drop in at this iconic eatery. This place has been here like this for ages, serving same old dishes for ages. But what this place maintains is their food quality. Though portion size is dropping in recent times, but the quality is still the same. This is their USP.

Today we decided to take Fish Fry & Fish Butter Fry. Though the fish fry portion is small, but the fish was fresh and tasted pretty delicious too. Fish Butter Fry, though a bit oily, tasted excellent. It’s portion was quite filling. It tasted better than fish fry. Even the sauce tasted delightful.

This place is ideal for takeouts for small cranky seating arrangement. But the plus point is that they make no compromise when it comes to food. Will surely visit here in future for some lip-smacking dishes.",positive

The best part about the whole visit was the Chocolate Marquise. It was truly heaven on plate. I felt the prices were high but a nice experience. One time visit for me just on the basis of price. Otherwise a great restaurant. Our total bill was 1850.,positive
10930,"This place needs to improve a lot in terms of their taste in food and also the delivery. The delivery experience wasn't bad but the food delivered was cold. This is the most dissatisfying thing. Secondly the food served was not up to the quality it should be. A chicken thalo was ordered in which the chicken pieces weren't good. The daal did not have taste. Rice was undercooked , lady finger curry was provided which was almost raw.  A sweet was also there which was ok and the best was the chutney which tasted nice although it was highly doubtable as to that was fresh or not. Taking all into consideration , this place needs to improve in terms of their quality, taste and delivery packaging to make it a recommended place unless so, this is not a recommended place. There are much better restaurants to eat with a but more price but they are wholesome and satisfying.",negative
4615,"Delivery Review:

This place is very near to my house. I did a take away of Biryani from them. There was queue too for the order take aways. Cause this was the evening of Panchami in Durga Puja.

• Order was:
1. Mutton Biryani - As per the taste it was not great. An average type of taste. Rice quality was also not good, the potato was coloured in a high volume. The smell of essence was coming out too much from the Biryani. And the quantity was very much average, can be consumed by a person easily & still that hungry person will need more things to kill the hunger.

Food: 3/5
Value for Money: 3/5",negative
4186,"This review is based on one order of crispy chicken and honestly there is nothing new to it. The food came in average - good packaging. Tasked quite good . Like how usually crispy chicken would taste like. Nothing surprising over there. Since I haven't tasted any of their other food items I can only expect them to be an average- good food joints.
However I do feel that they are slightly bit overpriced because I have had cheaper crispy chicken that tasted almost same.",negative
10077,"Went for a visit to another place but ended up here.
Ordered just 2 dishes so won't be a fair judgement,but then again, most places are based on 2 -3 dishes eaten by people who visit a restaurant.

Ordered the baby corn and it was pretty good to eat",negative

100,"I ordered for a office party on Friday. We ordered Garlic Naan, which was soft when arrived, so was the Butter Naan. The Biriyani (both chicken and mutton) were not the best, but okay-ish. The Chicken Tikka Butter masala was tasty, but not all the tikka were cooked very well and some had a reddish tinge. The Kadhai Paneer was perfect. What i liked was that even amongst huge orders that they receive on Fridays, still they were able to deliver on time and the food quality was decent. When you order for a office party, and your reputation is on the line, such prompt delivery and a “better than most” quality(and taste) matters.",positive

The Biryani Was Below Average In Taste. And The Chciken Piece On It Was Hard. If You Consider The Price Then It Was Okay. Quantity Was Good Enough.

The Chicken Chaap Was Also Average. The Chicken Pieces Served Here Were Not Good In Both Biryani And Chaap.
The Biryani Cost 70 Rs And The Chicken Chaap Cost 50 Rs.

Totally A Pocket Friendly Place Near Howrah Moidan To Have Biryani.

4854,"A well-known restaurant in North Calcutta. This place has been in the old-school part of the city for quite sometime now and has earned a name for its good quality and decent taste of Indian food. I am a contended customer of Mushroom for a couple of years now and talking about a recent purchase of tandoori chicken, the portion size might be smaller compared to many restaurants but tastes as nice and smokey as before.

We had
1. Paan shake
2. Chowpatty chatpata
3. Mix cheese sandwich
4. Oreo Pakoda
Paan Shake was so good and er refreshing. I really loved the saucy fry - Chowpatty chatpata. It was french fries with cheese and mayonese, with puffed rice as topping. It was different and awesome.
Sandwich was average.
I am such a sweet tooth person. All my rating goes for the Oreo pakoda, which I 1st time heard of and ate in my life. It was pakoda made of mashed oreo and added scoop of vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce. Really innovative and mouth watering in taste.

The Mutton Masala had one good sized piece of mutton in thick, rich, if slightly sweetish gravy and the two Tandoori Rotis couldn't have been a better accompaniment. Very satisfying indeed.

Two of us dug into the food to our hearts' content, washing it down with the piquant Ghol. The equally good part were the damages. Only ₹370 or so, for a hugely satisfying meal for two.",positive

So , as you can understand from ratings that items were very tasty. Chicken cheese roll was best , it's worth trying .
Considering the price point quality and quantity were justified .

42,"Aliah Restaurant at Park Circus is celebrating their 90years and thus offering 6 variations of Biriyani at just ₹99+GST. 
The offer continues till 10th of January.
.

6 variation includes-
1) Chicken Biryani 
2) Kachchi Biriyani 
3) Afgani Biriyani (Recommended)
4) Hyderabadi Biriyani 
5) Tikka Biriyani 
6) Reshmi Biriyani

I would personally recommend the Afgani Biryani. It is one exclusive biryani dish with spicy and dry fruits incorporated perfectly with rice and meat.

The service was okay on the basis on a regular day. 

Overall I really enjoyed the food and the ambience of this place.

A very popular place for college students..the pricings are pretty justified too. Food is fine.",negative

The Chinese starter was also equally good. This place is almost perfect regarding food, decor and the ambience. I will be back soon.

Once they start serving alcohol be prepared for a looong queue outside the restaurant.",positive

1898,"One of my favourite joint in Barrackpore.... From koley's my personal favourite dishes are Crispy chicken and drums of heaven... They have the perfect knowledge of spices... I hate to say this that once I ordered french fries from them but that was quite disappointing for me as m a big fan of fries... But all other things I tried from them is always satisfying...
They have a small sitting arrangement, so you will always found this place over crowded... It's just beside Barrackpore station so it's damn easy to access... I strongly recommend this place to all....",negative

1522,"If I don’t write about Nafeel, I do my own self an injustice.
My mother introduced me to Kathi rolls in this very place when I was in Class 1. Located bang opposite the Beckbagan tram depot, she used to pick me up from tuition, have a roll at Nafeel along with me, and then we used to board the tram back to Ballygunge.
Nafeel is still the same old understated place and over the years, I have come back to it again and again and again for its beef kathi rolls. A couple of decades have passed, the father has given way to the son, who mans the cash, but the quality and taste of the simple Kolkata kathi roll hasn’t changed 1% here. A beef kathi roll and a cup of tea worth all of Rs. 26/ is a king’s treat for me.  So when I am at airports or in other parts of India and find joints selling Kolkata kathi rolls at Rs. 200-300/, you know why I never have them. Because I know they will never be even remotely close to a Nafeel roll at all of Rs. 20/ even now in 2018.",positive

554,"This newly opened food joint is worth a try. The ambience and decor is simple yet likeable. Service is good but maybe will improve gradually with time. So we ordered, 1. KitKat shake
2. Chicken risotto
3. Chicken Lasagna
4. Pepperoni pizza.
Quantities were value for money and the foods taste quite good actually. What I didn't like was, what they used in pepperoni pizza was more of salami than pepperoni. And another disappointment was in main course they asked us to choose between potato and rice. Whereas the option should be given between bread rolls and rice. Overall a nice experience and the cafe deserves worth a try.",negative

We ordered 
Southwest roasted chicken Alfredo pasta 
Philadelphia Chicken Steak 
Roast turkey from the celebration menu 

The pasta though perfectly creamy was too less in comparison to the price. 
The steak was juicy  though the gravy was a bit on the salty side, the size was lacking again. 
We ordered two plates of Turkey. The cranberry sauce was perfect. So was the turkey. The fat was well roasted and went well with the sautéed vegetables and mashed potatoes. 
Also, we got complimentary dessert on the occasion of Christmas.

Every coffee lover, I am sure, will understand why all this “hype” about Starbucks.
This outlet has got a lovely ambiance with the huge glass panes overlooking the streets.. conducive to catch ups & conversations & a lot more.
We had cocoa cappuccino & hazelnut coffee which totally made our day.
I have tried their Irish coffee (the taste & aroma still lingers) along with the munchies before.. the seasoned cashewnuts & almonds, etc which I quite like.
Overall .. Starbucks is worth all the bucks & a million stars for what they are supposed to do .. serving amazing coffee!
Love the brand that it is :)

Happy eating 😊",positive

Now, coming to the food, we have ordered Kakori Kebab, Butter Naan (as Keema Naan was unavailable), Murgh Iraani & Mutton Metiabruz Biryani.

Coming to the food : I found one of their signature dim sums to be very average, the Baos are great and served smartly. As far as the rice bowl, I would rate Mamagoto better. 

They have one on one on beverages with the Zomato Gold so that’s a kicker. So far as pocket pinch is concerned; I would rate it overpriced.",negative
677,"The Fatty Bao provides you a beautifully lit up ambiance and a grad view of the Victoria Memorial Hall and St. Paul's Cathedral (provided you sit on the high chairs) but, most importantly they greet you with a smile.
Now coming to the food, they have to offer a wide range of sushi, ramen and what not.
I still have the taste of their California roll lingering in my taste buds. They also have a wide variety of cocktails available. I think their sangria red is one of the best I have tasted in town.

However,I could not taste the main course because they serve it only after 7pm and I went at 5pm.

Loved every item. Pulao was great, went perfectly with paneer butter red gravy. The only drawback I would say the quantity of the pulao was a little bit less according to me, otherwise it was perfect. Loved the parathas, especially the paneer paratha.

As starter they will offer u chicken soup with varieties of bread, chilly potato and chicken reshmi kebab. There are more than 5 types of salads are available for those who take diet seriously. In Chinese section noodles and fried rice were there with one typical chinese veg and one chicken preparation. In indian section we can choose rice or different type of rotis. Many veg preparations are there with two type of fish curry and one type of chicken curry. Best section is desserts, many options, n you cant have just one.

Rice was well cooked, dal was thick and homelike.
The torkari was really tasty and beyond my expectations.
The winner was the steamed rui. A huge piece of juicy soft rui with mustard gravy. Heavenly it was.
I never did have a fish like that to be honest.

2)Fish Meuniere~The pan-fried fish had the perfect softness and melted in our mouth.The boiled veggies were on point.The tangy flavor of lemon butter sauce was absolutely balanced.

The momo had enough amount of corn and I could taste quite a bit of white sauce kind of thing instead of much cheese in the momo. The USP of this place is definitely the price and the deal is pretty decent.,negative

7326,"Blu is one of the restaurants if the Auris Hotel at Theatre Road. One of the pretty posh areas of Kolkata and the interiors reflect that nicely. The plush blue chairs are the best part about the decor according to me. I was there for lunch on Friday. Food and presentation are quite good. The hospitality of the staff is good too. I had the following:-
Khowsuey- Pretty good! The condiments were spot on.
Baldamic Garlic Grilled Mushrooms- nicely grilled
Five Spice Chilli Fish- 👍
Papaya Salad
Thai Red Chicken Curry and Veg Green Curry with Sticky Rice
Pad Thai Noodles
Mango Sticky Rice
Overall, I would say that Blu scores well in terms of ambience as well as food. 👍👍👍👍

The pasta was cooked to perfection and was perfect for the kid. The fish and chicken was good. The prawn was also very nice. The leafy salad accompanying the prawn was very fresh and the orange slices added to it was nice The orange juice mocktail pitcher was very fresh. The only thing that could be improved upon was that for the price, the portions were a tad small.",positive
4950,"Ordering from this place is a waste of money. The chicken fried rice was okay though there wasn't much of chicken in there. It was bland. The crispy chilli baby corns were more like hard, sticky and chewy baby corn pieces that were not at all palatable. The chilli chicken was more like a chicken broth and the broth was totally bland. This has been the worst chilli chicken I have ever tasted.",negative

It is a 'must eat at' eatery for all food lovers. All their recipe continues to be made on the same old traditional recipes. There is no fancy seating or ambience . The shop is on one side of the narrow Decker's Lane and there are wooden benches to sit and eat on the opposite side , giving the semblance of the street side eatery. However , the amazing food more than makes up for that shortcoming. The Chicken Stew here cannot be matched by even the top 5 star restaurants of the country and the fish fry is to die for.",positive

The prawn har gao felt over cooked and the prawn was a bit on the rubbery side 
The pork baos were however exemplary. 
The soft shell crab sushi was not presented well ( if you have a closer look at my pics you can see the imperfections ) and the aioli was a bit too sweet for my palette. The pork ribs were great but again a bit salty for both of us. The theatrics and the taste of dessert ( chocolate ball) was nice.

My points will only count for the massive ambience and the staffs' courteous manner. Located at Eco Park, near gate no. 1. Went there at the late evenings, the restaurant was empty. Coming to the food, we ordered -

Starters: Prawn Tempura, Chicken Karaage

Main Course: Tori Yakimeshi, Mixed Yaki Soba, Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken in garlic and chili sauce

Mocktails: Virgin Mojito

The food quality and taste was good but it didn't fulfil my expectations. The food was not at all authentic Japanese. Also the pricing is more compared to the food taste and quantity. One suggestion: you guys have a plus point about the ambience, please work on that. Try to enhance the restaurant with authentic Japanese cuisine and demand to be a Japanese restaurant. Not before that!",negative

4216,"This place is very small to fit probably not more than 5 people at a go. The speciality is the pizza in a cone as the name suggests but it offers a variety of options like twisted potatoes, wraps,etc.I tried the Garlic pizza cone which contained a lot of jalapenos and bell peppers. I had expected more cheese but it had more of vegetables. But the taste was still very good.
You'll only visit the place if you have a craving for a Cone pizza. Otherwise it doesn't fill your stomach like the flat pizza does.",positive
8846,"Coffee world is situated on 3rd floor, of Acropolis Mall. The place is best known for serving best coffee, ice tea, hot drinks. The place is very cosy and perfect for spending time with friends or close ones.

We ordered -
➡️ Cappuccino.
➡️ Macchiato.
➡️ Molten Lava With Ice Cream.

Every drink they offer is made using the finest aromatic coffee beans roasted to perfection. Also the quantity of Cappuccino is huge. The molten lava is ideal for all the sweet tooth out there. The service is also prompt and courteous, which calls for a visit again. 😋",positive
8782,"La shivaaz, this place is absolutely lit.
Me and my friends came up to this place last night just to relax and enjoy and we have been coming here from quiet sometimes.
And what has been awesome about this place is its hookah and food combo, staffs here try to bring out the best and actually me and my friends share some great time here so we tend to visit this place quiet alot.
So last night we were upset as our favourite pasta was out of menu for the day, as the chef was not available. But we tried the veg biryani and veg and chicken hakka noodles and hookah toh tha hi😅
Suggestion: Do get the hookah combo. Where u get hookah along with that a dish, say we had veg hakka noodles but we always have veg white sauce pasta.
Nice place to spend quality time with friends and enjoy your evening.",positive

Pan fried fish- spicy and yummy
Badami reshmi kebab - okayish..
Bhetki bascili - continental item.. Loads of cheese and butter.. Tasted too good
For the main course we had
Mixed friedrice - very light and tasty
Mixed noodles- tasty as well with lots of prawn chicken
Tangy sweet and sour chicken-had 10 pieces
Chicken sanghai - mildly spicy
I didnt find much difference between the two chicken recipes.
Butter nun..
Mutton kosha.. Both tasted good
Overall had a good experience.. Wud recommand to visit..",positive

➡️Murg Malai Nazaqat : The chicken breasts marinated in cream and cheese were soft and the Malai over it gave it a drooling taste.
➡️Crumb fried Prawns : Another amazing item for starters. Crumb fried prawns served with tartar sauce.
|| MAIN COURSE ||
➡️Chicken Stroganoff : It's a traditional European delicacy. Shredded Chicken in white sauce and cheese accompanied with a portion of butter rice was really great.
➡️Spaghetti : Spaghetti in creamy cheese sauce mainly it's served with Bacon but instead of that we instructed it to toss with prawns.
➡️Chelo Kebab : Combination of boneless lamb and Chicken Kebab served with butter rice and grilled tomatoes.

The ambience is great with dim lights.",positive

307,Visited Jai Hind Dhaba for dinner with my friend and trust me we were not dissapointed. We first ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Paneer Tikka Roll. The Paneer Tikka was wrapped in the rumali roti and served with the mint and garlic chutney combo which was just awesome. We liked it so much that we had an extra one. We also tried Kadhai Paneer and Garlic Naan. Both were up-to the mark however I feel the naan could be more softer and better!!!!!,positive
4225,Have mostly ordered in from this place for some evening snacks. Have had their double cheese chicken roll and cheese chicken mushroom grilled sandwich. I’ve also had their steamed chicken momos. The quality and taste of the dishes were okay. A reasonably priced place for those sudden hunger pangs.,negative
7374,"This place is in Salt Lake, opposite to De Sovrani in the lane beside The Sonnet. This is a cozy restaurant with a smoking zone and an area where dining with smoking is allowed. The place is dimly lit and provides a sense of comfort.
The food we had was average but their Indian cuisine is better than the Chinese at least in the dishes that we had.
The most important plus point of the restaurant is their liquor menu. The prices are really less and doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket. And the best part is that they have a 2:1 offer on selected drinks !
They provide a wide selection of complimentary accompaniments with the drinks.
And Bira is also available !
The staff is really courteous and helpful.
Enjoy !",positive
2475,This is a small outlet just beside Camac Street Pantaloons. Ordered double decker chicken fries. Crispy french fries were served on a bed of mustard mayonnaise and cheese with chicken sausages on top! ❤️ Tasted sooo awsome! I loved it. Going to try the other fries as well!,positive

2336,"As a zomato gold member I had gone there for the live music event. The staff apparently didn't recognise our gold privilege tickets and there was some confusion over it. Once that resolved we got our place and the drinks coupons. However, again there was a confusion as we were given only two coupons instead of four (we had 2 tickets). That resolved, when we went for the drinks we were not given a proper choice for the drinks. We had to actually listen to other people giving orders and look around for the drinks served to know that sparkling wine was available too. Coming to the food we had ordered a fish steak and non veg kebab platter. The steak was good and so were the fish kebabs. But the chicken kebabs left us wanting something more. They were a bit more chewy than they were supposed to be. The music event was the redeeming factor. We thoroughly enjoyed the songs and the music. However, the service needs to be improved more.",negative

8181,"Thanks Food Gossip for giving us such a pleasant dinner tonight. Today I ordered 2 combo meals through online food delivery app. First combo was Chicken Hakka Noodles with 4 pieces Chicken Manchurian and second combo was Chicken Fried Rice and 4 pieces Chilli Chicken. I received this two combos at Rs 166/- within speculated time frame. 
Delivery man was very courtesies and well versed with GPS tracking system. 
I received my food steaming hot. Very satisfied with the stop notch packaging. Every items tasted really awesome. Chowmin was very decent and full of chicken. I loved chilli chicken over manchurian as Manchurian was little sweet whereas chilli chicken was spicy and flavourful. 4 big size chicken pieces were enough to fulfil your hunger issue. 
Food Gossip combos are perfect value for money food. Unexpectedly good combos. Will try again n again. Keep up the good work FOOD GOSSIP TEAM. 👍",positive

Conclusion:one can risk their money to taste their food items.",negative

1496,"I would like to come to straight to the point.
So I ordered Dragon's breath pizza from the place but what i got was lump of pizza tangling in cheese threads and the tomato sauce was scattered in the box.It was disaster.
I don't know whom to blame cause I felt the restaurant should have warn the delivery guy about the food he is taking.Since it was pizza it should have been carried horizontally but the delivery guy handed it over to me vertically.The box was in a plastic.Moreover the delivery guy should have been also more careful and responsible enough to bring the food as it was.Had to spend a disappointed Sunday evening seeing this picture of the food and specially when its pizza.

Truly the restaurants theme went with the way pizza got delivered only the exception was in GOT its lump of human flesh scattered in blood and here, well i have already mentioned before.I could really feel the ambience of the restaurant sitting at home.I was thrilled seeing the condition of pizza 😭😭",negative

3316,A sumptuous chopsticks licking experience. The kaisen salad and salmon fry tarutaru was especially awesome and so was the gyoza. The sushi platter was not upto my taste but that's a personal choice. The ambience is themed japanese though I would have preferred a complete floor seating section. They do have a private seating area. The only downside is we were told that the zomato 2+2 on drinks offer was not on all the drinks.,positive

They are very expensive, but from the atmosphere and laid back staff, you'll find it easier to spend.
I do recommend this place.",negative

Fried fish is their signature dish which has two big sized bhetki fillet fried to its optimum and served with french fries and boiled vegetables tossed in butter. This is most delicious fried fish I have ever had in my life.

Couple of times I had dinner as well. They serve both Chinese and North Indian food. In my opinion their North Indian food tastes better than the Chinese.",positive

Located : right opposite to the Lalit Great Eastern Hotel. They share the same unit with Picadilly Square. It's quite a blink and miss location, must say.

Ordered:
* A ghee idli
* A molgapodi dosa that comes with gun powder
* A filter coffee
* A walnut brownie
* A Ferrero rocher brownie.

Loved each of these, except for the fact that the I didn't quite like the gun powder that they make it here. However it's wroth mentioning that they serve 6 varieties of Chutney with all the dishes and they are yum, specially the garlic one.

A must visit for the south indian cuisine lovers.",positive

Bhetki skewers was made with real bhetki and it was just a cherry on the top.
The ambience was just amazing with some great past time games such as carrom, pool and what not.
The wall was covered with pictures of world class players such as Messi, Ronaldo, Ganguly, Saina Nehwal, and so on.

My, order was via Uber eats. They still have the special lunch offer. I ordered CHICKEN BAR B Q & CHILLI CHICKEN.

•Chilli chicken:- it comes in 8 pieces. Chicken pieces were super soft they just melted in mouth. In terms of taste it was finger licking good. Only thing was it was spicy which chili chicken isn't supposed to be.

•Chicken Bar B Q:- shredded chicken mixed with plenty of sauce, a bit of Chilli. Justified quantity as per price. In terms of taste you won't be disappointed, might look red hot but its not that spicy. A good dish to have with roti apart from rice.",positive

Neither any washroom facilities are available till now.

• Egg chicken cheese dosa (4/5)

Fish Finger
Paneer pakora
Chicken cutlet
Dhakai Veg Pulao
Dum Murg biriyani

Egg Devil with Mutton: This is much larger than your regular devil. And there was a huge stuffing of mutton Keema. The only thing that wasn't to my liking was the stuffing which was more on the sweeter side.

Special Prawn Cutlet: Now this one I really loved. The coating was soft and the filling of prawn was really tasty. I guess it's a different snack and must be tried by prawn lovers.

Overall a good experience. A small joint for freshly made tasty snacking.",positive

1217,"This restaurant is located in Park circus. Easy to locate, as it is just five minutes walk from the seven points.
The ambience of this place is okayish, nothing special about it. But the celeing on the first floor ( AC area) is too low, you will have to tilt your head while walking, which is very inconvenient.
The prices for the AC and the non AC areas are different. They charge quite an extra money for it.
Now coming to the food, we ordered-
• Khuska rice - Basically it is the rice of the biriyani without the meat or egg. It just have the potato. This dish was fairly simply, yet filling.
• Tandoori roti - The rotis were soft and nice.
• Chicken kashmiri - This I think was the best thing I tried here, it has one large piece of chicken in a rich gravy, not very spicy or hot. It also had few makhanas or foxnuts.
The price is quiet affordable too.

Food : Had some amazing delicacies. I personally loved their Crispy Chilli Babycorn, it was crisp outside and was tossed well. In the mains Kali Dal and Naan was amazing. Suprisinly, I somehow liked the Veg Biryani, not any where near the original Biryani but still.
The dessert was not upto to the mark. They served Darshan which was not crisp and pretty thin. This can be improved.

Very frankly speaking, the only thing I have been impressed with was the décor of the place.The dim lights into the restaurant and the designer artefacts hanging from the ceiling created an enchanting prelude but soon the short lived halcyon disappeared.
Neither the starters nor the main course passed the test,one of the many reasons for that disliking was that the foods had gone cold unexpectedly.Well it was a buffet menu,so I was expecting most of the foods to be served hot.In the main course, the rice with corn kernels and veggies was tasteless and the mutton curry was nothing but horrible.So improperly cooked that it seemed that it would take a saw to cut the mutton chunks.The only hope was the dessert section having Gulab Jamun,brownies and Vanilla Ice Cream making up for the rest of the disaster.The red velvet cake was fine.
The experience did not match the expectations.",negative

1821,"First dining experience at the Kolkata chapter. To sum it..the food was similar to other cities but the sevice standards were truly pathetic. The restaurant in Kolkata is perhaps the largest Peshawri. We were seated next to a table with around 10 diners...mostly foreigners. They were creating a total ruckus and the floor staff did not warn them for their decibel level...the luxury of being 'white' . Once they left...their table was cleaned, only to drop all the leftovers on the floor. This mess kept on lying there till we protested. The manager said the housekeeping was arriving. Does it need 10 mins for housekeeping to arrive. The service was slack...burnt papad was served and table not cleared. No one come to ask for repeat beverages. The cutlery was not unifom (the spoons were of two kinds) and furniture in shambles. Despite the good food, the service and environment left a lot to be desired...this Peshawri is best avoided.",negative

The big letdown were the meat pieces. Tasteless, boiled mutton pieces were served with the rice. Pretty evident that they were made separate and stuffed together in the parcel. Even the meat wasn't cooked through and was unpleasantly chewy, rubbery at times and absolutely tasteless.
Had the meat been there and cooked with the rice in the degh, the experience could have been better.
Not the best impression made, on the first time.
Unfortunately, no pictures to show this time around.
Maybe next time, if I summon enough courage to order. Or Zomato brings some exciting offer, hard to refuse.
Till then, the neighborhood has better options.

They even had dhaba style chai to help you kick start the day. Honestly speaking, though it is a luxury spa resort but I did not expect so much from the breakfast spread here. If you are ordering from the à la carte, which we did during lunch time do order Kesari rasmalai. It's very good.",positive

Imagine a long drive, followed by a short swim and then exquisite Oriental Quisine waiting for you.

The Orient at Raichak on Ganges will provide all of that.
•A long drive to Raichak from Kolkata.
• A swim
• Amazing food which is not limited to but rather includes-
Garlic Batter Prawn
Honey Glazed Chicken
Dimsum
Padthai (Flat Noodles)
Young Chow Fried Rice
Thai Green Chicken Curry

The food was absolutely lip smacking and while we only tasted the food, we did crave for more.

We ordered:
🍛Plain Rice (80/-)
Steamed Basmati Rice

Sweet and fragrant pulao. It's sweet but doesn't kill the taste of your other gravy, Which I liked the most. [4.5/5]
🍛Chital Machher Muitha (315/-)
Boneless chital fish cooked in a spicy Bengali- style gravy. Tastes amazing. [5/5]
🍛Gondhoraj Murgi (275/-)
Chicken cooked in fragrant lime gravy with zest. It's a perfect combination with Plain rice. [5/5]

Spicy Chicken curry. You can have it with Rotis. Tastes good.

Needless to mention that I was disappointed, however had to change my mind after having the first spoonful. The aroma was subtle. The taste was very different, yet very pleasing.

✔️The waiters didnt seem interested in serving. we were not provided with fork or water. we had to call and ask them thirce and onlythem we got the waterand the fork was never given to us.
⚠️this place is perfect for people who just like to drink. when it comes to family or friends this place should be skipped.",negative
4179,"As we went to Shyambazar today for shopping, just thought of having some food at Dimpi. The main attraction was chilled curd (in form of Dahi Vada or Chat). As planned, we ordered for one plate of Dahi Vada & one Papri mix chat.

Quality- Good.
Papri was fresh mixed with kabuli chana, raisins, tomato pieces, pudina chatni, fresh curd and garnished with bhujia n pomegranates. The Dahi Vada was equally good n fresh.
Portion was good also.

I was disappointed with the room temperature curd in chat, expected it to be chilled.

Price wise okay. Ambience okayish, not great. The place seems to me a bit cramped. And it was crowded too. Mr Amar attended us and made us comfortable. Dimpi",negative

5746,"Nicely done. The foods were great. The service prompt. I loved the decor of the family dining floor. The bar can improve. Should stock more options. Plus, it gives a rugged feel in the bar. Tables too small, the wicker ceiling too close.

I loved the starters. Both Indian and Chinese options were great. Specially liked the Amritsari Fish and Lat Me Kai. Somehow felt the tandoori items are a bit neglected. Chicken Reshmi Kebab was average and not as good as the other items.
Cocktails and beers are bit overly prized.

Staff attitude is a bit obnoxious. They need to understand everyone have their own frustration and it harms the restaurant if you are rude to your customer. I am not a regular and considering the small spat as one off incident. Others may not be that objective.

I got myself a nearbuy offer, had everything chicken - hot and sour soup, drums of heaven, chicken in hot garlic sauce, fried rice and hakka noodles. As it was a combo meal, I believe the quantity had been cut down to fit it's pricing. I have to say, their service is great, I would recommend this place purely based on how accommodating their service is. On the taste part, well it falls short on my expectations. Other than that it's a better place in the neighborhood.

Thanks to the super efficient service of Zomato,their genial deliveryman delivered the food within half an hour. The egg chicken gravy noodles was nothing short of a disaster. The fried egg pieces were almost non existent and the fried noodles that was given separately had a orange hue(probably due to the use of excessive food colour). The worst part was the gravy, it was tongue burning hot, with peanuts and chicken shreds making up the rest. Never experienced such excessive use of fried cheap quality half burnt peanuts in gravy chowmein. The fish manchurian was somewhat better. The quality of fish was good and the manchurian pieces were somewhat decent in size.I think the restaurant has a lot to do to improve their food quality.Not recommended for those who really enjoy tasty food.",negative

2091,"I was nearby this morning and was looking for places where breakfast is served. This one came up at top due to ratings.
The place is easily recognisable as it's on main road. The interior decoration is top notch. It has so many aspects to its ambience. And that is in fact the only praise I can sing for them.
The food menu is exorbitantly overpriced. Even in airport terminals we don't pay this much. Then on bill they charged 10% for service. We were surprised and asked them to waive it off which they cordially did.",negative
9343,I am a frequent customer of Zareen.. I love their mutton sultane biriyani and of course their great packaging ... Most importantly they are keeping the quality as it.. However this time I feel the quantity is less compare to my previous orders.. Hopefully authority will check this..,positive
41,"I currently went in for the Great Biryani Festival here and they had 5 types of biryani- Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tikka Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Biryani, Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani and Afghani Biryani. We ordered all of them and my favourite were the Tikka and the Reshmi ones. The Afghani Biryani has a flavourful rice with dry fruits and chicken whereas the Hyderabadi Biryani was a little more spicier than the rest with curry leaves and South Indian spices. The festival ends on 11th January, 2019, so give it a try. Each plate for ₹99/-!",positive
3821,Food is good but delivery charge is little higher than usual .do not expect great food . Its a small local food joint and according to price quantity and quality is decent .,positive

4032,"This place is not up to the mark as compared to the other restaurants of park street. Their Chinese combos are average but everything else just gives me chills. I had ordered chicken fried rice and chicken Manchurian both of which were pretty basic as compared to the high cost of these dishes. On the other hand, there chicken biryani had a foul smell and was uneatable. We were still charged for the  dish. Even the drinks are high priced. Wont be visiting this place anytime soon.",negative
11309,I visited to this small outlet during the Festive time. The taste of Biriyani was average and most importantly half of the item was not available so I got little bit dissatisfied.Ambience was basic and hardly 4 to 5 people can sit at a time.,negative

7947,"Place or atmosphere doesn't matter when the food entices one.. same thing happened to me when I went to this place, the atmosphere was average but when I gulped in hot spicy food inside my mouth my taste buds started commenting ""wow! I love it"".. I am fond of the pan fried momo.. definitely a must go place if one wants to taste some fingerlicking Chinese cuisines.",positive

4818,I ordered a paneer cheese roll and the stuffing was good but it really lacked cheese. Packaging could have been better. hope to get better roll next time as the taste was good.,negative
4616,Very average food quality. Tried their rolls and kebabs. Reasonable price but food quality is not so good. Also the hygiene is not properly maintained as this joint is beside that main road. Rotis are openly made there. So giving 2 star in 5.,negative
8506,"Special thali is just an eye wash, they have only one variant a normal thali and that too they are charging Rs. 20 as packing charges as the normal rate and the delivery rate differed rs 20, no matter what you order they will deliver the basic normal thali only.",negative
7644,"This place is okay for a sumptuous dinner with family and friends. We had Drums of heaven , Fish Manchurian and Chicken Schezwan Noodles. The quantity of the noodles were enough for 3 people to eat fully. They do give a good quantity. Service too was ok. But the decor can be developed to attract more people.
Advice: Its better not to order icecreams and desserts from here.",negative
2533,"I would have given this place 3 only if they take a little care about hygiene here, rest food is above average, little oily rolls, parathas but nice as per budget. Chicken biriyani is good quantity wise, taste wise could be better. Momos I found to be soft, tasty filling and cheap as well.",negative
10761,"This outlet is located at the 2nd floor of CC1 inside Hangout food court. Taste wise its mediocre but chicken lollipops tasted good. The food was delivered much late. Ambience is good, you can visit here with your family and friends.",negative

4640,"Situated close to airport on the highway, can be an option if you are famished and home is still far away. Won't suggest to folks with top priority as hygiene, nope, you won't find that here. No parking space, though the guards manage to get the job done by using the road and blocking traffic. Food is not bad, again if you are too hungry. Ambience is okay. Had to wait for a long time for food, the only time I visited this place.",negative
1066,"Two points just because their food was fine, otherwise this place deserved way less. The service was horrible. Nobody offered a menu or even water for about 15 mins after sitting and that also after we had asked for it. Also we just got a glass of water even when we were 2 people. The table wasn't cleared of previously used glasses. It wasn't even laid properly with some of the cutlery missing. The glasses weren't clean. But the servers were too busy gossiping amongst each other to actually attend to the customers.
I am shocked that this kind of place has received such high ratings.",negative
7251,"nice simple place decent food with medium spices and right amount of oil in the food overall  value for money
there is nothing speical to mention food is avg dal paneer, yes Naan is huge and soft, zeera rice i thought had too much zeera in it.",positive
5216,"In frame- Peri peri cheese sauce momo.
Price- Rs120.
Location- Refuel.
.
.
This is a very small food joint located in bangur avenue.
They serve only vege delicacies and their momos are being appreciated quite a lot.

This peri peri cheese sauce momo was very spicy and veerrrrry cheesy and the gravy was filled with capsicum and corn well fried with cheese.
The sauce in which the momos were dipped was verrry tasty but the momos were just average.
Though it is a worth for money.
And if you love cheese then you have to try it.",negative
2419,Went here at Ballygunje branch during durga puja and ordered two sweets. Those were Malai Chomchom and Chanar Payes . Both were very nice in taste having a great quality . Prices are in higher side. It was the first time in Gupta Brothers and experience was well enough.,positive
6527,"okk first time i'm writing review on the basis of delivered food.actually i want to give 3.5 out of 5.but there is no option.
this restaurant is located in my locality(banik more,birati).
i ordered three items-

Paneer tikka(4/5,paneer chunks tasted very soft and were grilled perfectly.)

Fish finger(3/5, it tasted crunchy outside but the portion of fish inside should be increased)

Chicken hakka noodle(3.5/5,adequate quantity,moderately tasted but quite oily)

they delivered the food as soon as possible.i'm hoping for more quality-food as it's perhaps the only standard food-joint in my locality.",negative
7102,"AMBIENCE - Ambience was pretty neat, small yet beautiful. Some indoor games and a guitar is there for visitors so that you can have a great time there.

FOOD ORDERED - Fresh Lime Soda, Virgin Mojito, French Fries, Mango Smoothie, Chicken Grilled Sandwich, Chicken Wrap.

FOOD REVIEW - Fresh Lime Soda was ok, sweet was little lacking. Virgin Mojito was good. French Fries was top notch, perfectly made. Mango Smoothie was thick was and again it was damn good. Chicken Grilled Sandwich comes with 2 pcs of sandwich and tasted good. And lastly the Chicken wrap was extremely satisfying, plenty amount of chicken, mayo and other ingredients.

FINAL WORDS - French Fries, Smoothie, Chicken Wrap highly recommended. Overall experience was very good and cost was pocket friendly.",positive
6206,"Ordered rumali rotis, soya tawa chap masala, dal makhani for lunch. The dal makhani was pretty average...the elaichi in it made the taste slightly funny. The soya tawa chap masala was good, bordering on the tangy side. The rumali rotis were decent. Overall, an average wholesome meal.",negative

6082,"I ordered from Aha! biryani two months back, when they were kind enough to deliver food for an office party.

Glad that Zomato's delivery service enables to order their food to Lake Gardens.

I had ordered their Chicken Biryani and it stands different from the rest of the outlets in the city : New ones or the even the legacy ones.

You don't feel sick after eating from here and the taste is on the Spicer side, and you will love it. Ample quantity that serves 1 but the quality is what you should look out for.

Thanks guys for providing raita and spoon in request. Really helps!",positive
9664,"If you’re looking for healthy, hygienic, and very tasty home style food look no further. Turban Tadka is run by two brothers and provides some of the best food that I’ve had in Kolkata. They deliver my dinner to me every night and in addition to the tasty food what bowls me over is that the two brothers, who deliver the food themselves, are super courteous and cooperative. They’re constantly seeking feedback and trying to improve their offering and the effort that they put in to maintain the quality of food shows. There is amazing variety and the menu keeps changing so one does not get bored. Ofcourse it only helps even more that there’s a surprise in the form of a special dish/ sweet dish every now and then. I am from Chandigarh and have found my own mini Punjab here in Kolkata when it comes to food. Do try out the food from Turban Tadka. I guarantee you won’t regret it.",positive

4486,"So I went to this place and I loved the ambiance here, something unique and nice. May be it was a wrong decision to opt for this cafe being a vegetarian, but that's what I did. They do not have much options in veg so we ended up ordering crispy chilli Babycorn, Kadhai paneer, Dal Makhani, Masala Kulcha and Butter naan. The food was not more than what we call pure average. The thing I disliked the most was the behaviour of the staff. No instances of misconduct or anything as such but they were not welcoming enough. They did not follow our instructions. They left the food on the table and we had to call them back to serve us. We had to remind them for stuffs again and again. Won't be visiting this place again.",negative
2215,"The name itself is self-explanatory! This is a house for steaks! This 'Steaky' joint is located in Southern Avenue. They serve amazing steaks.
The interior is quite funky and I love all those foodie quotes on the wall! This place has a seating capacity of approximately 15 people.
Now coming to the main section that is food. I have tried the following items:-
▪Big Monsta Burger (Pork)- I love this burger. The meat is well cooked. The sunny-side up egg is pure bliss!
▪Mexican Chicken Steak in Pepper Sauce- The chicken steak is cooked with pepper sauce and served with mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables.

The food was good, the staff is very polite and helpful. On the whole it was a good experience!",positive
7111,One of the oldest restaurants in the hatibagan area as I have heard of this place from my parents a lot of times. Recently they have decorated this place and I have too say it's quite good. It is famous for its kabiraji and this type of other snacks. They also serve chinese here which is also very good. The kabiraji here is just heavenly and can easily be compared with the mitra cafe's.,positive
8874,"Really like the place, it's cozy and the decor has an European feel 😊 we ordered two pizzas, one refreshment and tea.. It also has a store, with amazing collection of ethnic attires and home decors.. The food is yum but it could be better.. Hospitality is good.. Pocket friendly too..",positive

1509,"Recently went for a biriyani along with mutton hanglabari at this place.
The biriyani was one of it's lighter kind. Not like how the quintessential biriyani is supposed to be, rich and spicy. However it was on the okayish side.
Coming to the mutton side dish, though the gravy was pretty good, the mutton pieces majorly consisted of bones with very less flesh to it. That was a really put down to am otherwise okayish meal.",negative

5617,I've been visiting The Shack Lounge quite often now. It is usually quite crowded so we call the owner and make reservation usually. The hookah is usually very good but if we order the mint flavor hookah it burns down due to the coal very quickly. The flavor burns down and it starts chokking us. The food is very good. Especially the combo reduces the price of the hookah and food items. The crowd is quite cheap few days and the ambience is very good. The staffs are quite friendly and well behaved.,positive
1,What more to say about a place that we keep on visiting again and again. It is THE best buffet in town...keep up the good work guys...may your kebabs remain as great as your service,positive
5137,The ambience is extremely shady.. so shady that you can't even view your food or the person you are sitting with. The staff behavior is nonsensical. They don't even serve water. I had ordered chilli chicken and roti both of which were priced more highly than usual. In the restaurant itself they served me chilli fish instead of chicken. I told them about it and all they had to say was no we're not wrong and if we serve you fish it's on your benefit. Who sees benefit when ordering??? It's you and your sole choice what you'd want to eat. How can the restaurant staff dictate that. I was disgusted with their behavior. And don't recommend anyone this place. Utter nonsense. I guess that's why they keep the decor shady that whatever they serve you.. you can't see and can't even recognize. I am extremely dissatisfied. They spoilt my evening.,negative
2485,It’s no doubt a happening place. It was a “ladies night” special so my girls and I didn’t have to pay the entry fee. The place was packed with youngster. The drinks were on the house but we had to pay for the food. Food tasted average. Pretty sure no one goes to eat but to have a fun time with friends. I must say the dj was awesome that night! Ended up with a sprained leg later that night but that’s acceptable for good dance music!,negative

Thank you Wow Bangla for making my day awesome.",positive
399,"It's a rooftop restaurant. It has a very casual feel to it with Jacuzzi and nice tables topped with canopies. They had live music which made the atmosphere even more pleasant.
The food was good, but there can be improvements. The parsley momos were good. Loved the peanut dip with it. The thai paneer was too strong in taste, though it's a highlight there. Pan-fried noodles were also well prepared.
The servers were earnest and helpful but can be more refined.",positive
11301,"A place with a soothing view. some places you remember for the way they serve and look and then there’s places that you remember for how they make you feel..and it’s definitely one such place. close to my house..a place with a view where you can sit and let yourself be healed after a tiring day. 
 by the way aur ek baat dikhne mein thik thak lekin service bohat hi bakwas. waiters r busy to impress girls. and ek order dene k liye hum e uth ke jana pad raha hain , and hum e mocktail mila nehi bohat sara., sirf 3 mocktails available its very unfair",negative
9083,"I have ordered and got food delivered from this place several times. I once found pork chunks in my (chicken) noodles instead of pieces of chicken. It didn’t bother me much because I am a liberal Bengali, but for those who have religious issues would have had a very bad experience. Moreover, the Chicken Thukpa tasted so bland and empty. I mostly order Mixed Pan Fried Noodles because of its sauce and its quite filling. The Fried Momos tasted like they have been dipped in low quality oil. 

I rated it 3 Stars as they have placed the prices accordingly with the food quality. 

I hope they improve their food standards.",negative
7641,Delivery on proper time.Quality and quantity both are good.Moreover packaging is ok.It is very much pocket friendly.It is highly recommended.,positive

7025,"We were searching for a lounge standing in the middle of the streets on this Saturday night, and suddenly discovered it on Zomato.. We went there with zero expectation and found out it's a super happy lounge with great music and awesome services. We ordered a blueberry-kiwi hookah, some nachos, creamy pasta and some hard drinks. We love the crazy ""Quantum"" theories written on the wall with the doodles. We also loved the decor, especially the lights and seating arrangements. Another cozy place to hangout with friends in south Kolkata with some super friendly hosts, will surely visit again. Srinanda Chakraborty",positive
2777,The restaurant is good but some where I felt that the quantity is not sufficient as per pricing.. I ordered from here couple of times.. I was not disappointed but work on quantity as well.. I agree quality matters but when other restaurants offer much more in same price you guys should think about that also.. Overall it's a good place to eat..,positive
9054,Located near chingrighata crossing adjacent to a sweet shop this is a small joint located down the lane..Today I tried their chicken roll while I was on my way from work...The roll was a bit oily but tasted superb..The chicken portions were well cooked and proportioned..They serve varieties north Indian and Chinese dishes..A good place for that quick bite if u r nearby..Its an ac restaurant and the service is very prompt and friendly.,positive

1839,"We have been there last week for team dinner. We have been offered with special corporate package with bottled drinks. They charged around Rs. 700 AI for 2 veg starters, 2 non veg starters. 2 veg main course and 2 non veg main course. Only fish starter was good all other food was very ordinary. They are specialized for chicken wings but that one was too bad. Drink they used to serve with special bottle pricing which is good thing for drinkers. Never go here for only food.

One shocking thing I noticed, we were almost full with drinks and starters so requested them to bring main course with very less quantity. They didn’t listen and brought huge quantity. When we said them, we don’t want to waste food so take them upfront. They replied, nothing will be wasted, you eat how much you can, will return back remaining food. It is so unhygienic. I will never go to this place again.",negative

We tried a lot of varients as we were a big group .

Some of my favorites were-

BBQ sticky orange glazed chicken wings (best wings with a little sweet kick )
Grilled fish with lemon butter caper sauce (this was the best grilled fish I have ever tried , a must must try)
Green Thai curry with steamed rice ( I am not very fond of Thai curry as the coconut tastes overpowers it but if u like thai then do try)
Chicken steak with BBQ sauce ( the only prob with this was the quantity)
Bourbon shake
Raspberry herbal tea ( fav)
Hot chocolate",positive

10929,"This outlet is situated in Behala. Ahare Bahare is quite a catchy name. But the food isn't.

This outlet need to improve a lot. I ordered Misty Polau, Egg Chicken Polau & Fish Oly from this outlet. Misty Polau was decent among the all, but when it comes to Egg Chicken Polau they lost the Ghee matter a lot. It was way much dry & Polau dishes suppose not to be that. Coming to the Fish Oly, I think I was cheated. Fish Oly was in main dish & when I recieved it feels like a starter. It was deep oil fry, 4 in piece with a kind of fish which stinks. 

If you guys want to have Bhasa fish & prawns at a competitive price please call 9051345272. 

Apart from the taste, when it comes to packaging I really liked the way they pack. One should try their chicken and rice dishes as I reviewed all the reviews along with my personal experience.",negative

They have various options for choosing ones favourite bowl even customization is available I guess that is one of the best part. There oriental bowl, noodle bowl, hariali chicken bowl is worth having it and one bowl will fill your hunger well . Even they have kept salad bowl that's also quiet heavy and it'll fill ones tummy well and even it's good for ones diet . There dessers are also very lip smacking I opted for a common one that is brownie with ice cream and it was good . I liked my visit to this place as it valued my money and filled my tummy well .So would definitely visit again. There new additions are really amazing . Even the chillers are so refreshing to beat the heat in a hot summer day .",positive

I had ordered Mysore masala dosa. It was wrapped within a banana leaf and aluminum foil which is quite fascinating.

One item that does have scope for improvement is the Chicken Mei Foon, which isn't bad taste wise, but I feel it can taste better, given the standard of other dishes at this same restaurant.

A must try is the honey chicken and the Kim Li Loi special fried rice. If there's one dish you should simply not miss, it's their Chicken Hakka noodles. Tastes better than other restaurants' Hakka noodles.

The ambience of the restaurant itself is simple, home style, nothing great but the food is good given it's pocket friendly price.",positive

First, they had no idea regarding the offer that a Zomato gold member supposed to have during the session. They kept us waiting for 3 minutes, followed by a confusion over how many complementary drinks to be served. When that was cleared, they informed that the complementary drinks are select, nothing wrong in that but mind you, these select brands belong to a category (or should I write 'class') that they do not have (as that would not look good) in their menu card!!
Leaving apart this experience,may I highlight that the kabab platters tastes bland. The grilled fish steak has nothing unique as compared to the other steaks served around Kolkata.
They even did not serve/ask to serve water!
Table remained mostly unattended.

Nothing can be more appalling.",negative

The Biriyani was quite good as well.. Also their steamed fish tasted quite delectable and different.. The offer allowed us the privilege of getting complimentary soft drinks.. The ambience is exemplary.. The best in Kolkata.. Don't miss this ethereal buffet spread.,positive

10292,"We visited there on a Sunday afternoon. Small joint,Ambience is quite good and decoration is not very classy.
Ordered chicken Meefoon,chicken fried rice, Mongolian chicken and sliced chicken in schezwan peeper.

1.chicken Meefoon- quantity was good and enough for 2. Taste was also good.

2.chicken fried rice- quantity was not enough for 2.
Taste- Meefoon was better than rice.

3.Mongolian chicken- quantity good (10boneless chicken pieces). But sorry I know the taste of Mongolian style chicken but what they made that was just chicken in soya sauce.

4.sliced chicken in schezwan peeper- quantity and quality wise good.

Best part is they serve us mineral water for free.

Try to better Mongolian chicken and fried rice.

Total bill- 914/- (including tax)

Good for one time visit only.",negative
9872,"Perfect place 2 chill out after a busy day or laze over the weekend.....interior is catchy...done in deep hues of red and black with flowing porcelain figurines and interesting graffiti where the human female form merges seamlessly into...yah...guessed right....zebras!

The pool board is well maintained with options to watch the latest game on the tele.

Service and food quality is exceptional....try checking out with the folks on the day's special. Both veg and non veg platters are yummy....could try the prawn or corn items.

Cocktails are magical blends churned out by the very amiable Sumanta. Ask nicely and u may be surprised at his creations.

Management oversight is cool and friendly....all the while allowing u the wee bit of yearned for personal space without being too obtrusive. Kudos to Mr. Naeem who is always around as the ever smiling and very efficient floor manager!",positive

83,I ordered Chicken Biriyani from Zam Zam for dinner tonight as I had heard a lot about this joint however to my disappointment I didn’t like the biriyani. The reason being I’m from UP and we like spicy food..even though people from Kolkata think that this biriyani is spicy but hell no! It tasted more like rice and chicken with little salt. But this is because I love spicy food so you must give it a shot to know for yourself. :),negative

Decor : not good

Service : Prompt

Food Ordered :
Dahi vada mixture 
Schezwan Masala Dosa
Gun powder Chutney
Chaas (butter milk)

Description : This restaurant is very near to my office. Was attracted with the varieties of dosas they offer. 
Dahi vada mixture is something different. It a dahi vada topped with mixture (chanachur). 
Schezwan Masala Dosa is also different item. Never tried it. Its Masala is as good as any restaurant. But disappointing part was Chutney n sambhar which is the main part of a south indian restaurants. 
Gun powder Chutney was average.
Chaas is excellent. Though it was little high on spices.
Overall average experience. Can be tried if someone wants to something different.",negative

8925,"My orders after consulting with the Waiter thrice were 1. Chilli Garlic Chicken(repeatedly told the waiter to avoid chillies and make it simple Garlic Chicken) 2. Chicken Fried Rice. 3.Chicken Cheese corn Sandwich.

What i personally feel is they must keep their menu simple and authentic. They serve Continental,Mughlai,Indian,Biryani,Chinese under the same small roof. And to serve the diverse menu,they are not cooking it Authentic.

The fried rice lacked the flavours in it.
And the Garlic Chicken was Chilly Chicken in White Sauce. After repeating thrice to the waiter,they horribly failed to meet the expectations and we had to leave without completing our ordered food. Why add chillies when we had requested repeatedly to avoid it?

I really wish they improve their communication between the waiter and the arrogant Chef.
Sandwich ordered was good though. And interiors are good. Pocket Pinch is decent.
Please improve the service very soon.",negative

Kadai paneer tasted really good and was ample in quantity. With capsicum, onions and tomatoes the gravy was well made, and chunks of paneer took it a level up..

As much good was kadai paneer, mutton dopyaza was levels worse .. The worst I had had in that price. 4 pieces of so called mutton had only hard inedible bones and no meat at all. Also the gravy was disgraceful with loadstf of peas in it. It also makes me wonder how the restaurant arranged for peas in the monsoons, that too in overloaded amount..

I will describe the decor first.
The decor is simply gorgeous. Everything is done with utmost precision. They even have a fountain inside!! Each corner is pouring with elite class bangaliana.
Coming to the food:
I ordered the non veg thali.It consisted of:
Aloo Bhaja- Crispy
Luchi- Two phulko luchi
Cholar Dal- To dunk the phulko luchis
Rice- Basmati Rice
Macher matha die cholar Dal- Perfect quinquennial Bengali home food, perfectly paired with the rice.
Chicken kosha- The pieces were not good.But the taste was good.
Fish kalia- The fish was not well marinated.The gravy could have been better.
Chatni- Typical Bengali mango chutney.yummy.
Rosogolla-Nice.
Papad-well...crunchy.

Overall food Verdict is...the food is pretty mediocre.But the decor and ambience is very pretty.
Quite easy on the pocket. But the service is too slow.

It is very unlike the other drink shops at Kolkata.

Things I had here includes Caramel Popcorn Shake, Strawberry Choco from the section of thick shake. A special mention to the Caramel Popcorn shake. It had a very unique flavour which still lingers on my mouth. I had the Alphonso mango from the fruity shakes and the cold coffee from the classic shakes. Each and every shakes are executed very well and worth a try.

The tandoori aloo was stuffed with rich cottage cheese(chhena) and dry fruits. They were made to perfection and were delectable.

Aglio olio pasta too was good and there was consistency in the taste and texture.

Triple Treasure was exotic vegetables like broccoli, bell peppers, baby corns and mushrooms sautéed in a mildly spicy gravy. It was okayish. Mushrooms spoiled the dish to an extent.

Chilli Paneer was crispy, spicy and scrumptious. Although almost full we couldn't leave even a single piece of it.

9172,This place is just below my friend's apartment and thus we take food from this place very often. They are tadka specialists as a reason to which the tadkas and dal fry are must try in here. Also the chicken they serves in form of Kassa and Curry are enough to satisfy your taste buds. We also take away their rotis and parathas regularly. Hope they continue their run of serving this pocket friendly meals.,positive

What I tasted from their outlet?

The fine special noodles and also their egg chicken gravy noodles.

The first & foremost thing that I'll like to introduce to the readers is about the quantity.
No compromise on it, they offer a lot compared to the pricing.

Taste?
The fine special noodles comprises all the rich features of mushroom, chicken, egg & prawn - perfectly tossed & aggressively priced.
Tastes good enough, so does the gravy chowmein.

Classic & rich flavours.

Way to go The Fine, would be hoping that people give some generous thoughts to this place coz this place deserves atleast a 4+ star rating.

Best wishes.",positive

247,"Heard a lot of praises about this place; while it certainly served delicious food with a unique twist, it wasn't as extraordinary as the reviews claimed.

We ordered their trademark specials - Dajaj Chermoula and Beer Can Tempura Fish. The former was four chicken leg pieces, beautifully charred and very juicy, served with a mayo dip. *Strongly recommended*.
The latter was basically fish fingers with a unique plating. It had a light fried coating due to the beer batter and served in a Budweiser beer can with an orange dip. I didn't really find this starter to be a standout.

For the mains, we ordered Coq-Au-Vain and Shepherd's Pie. Coq-Au-Vain is *strongly recommended*. The chicken pieces were plentiful and succulent and the dish had a rich flavour to it. My only suggestion would be to increase the quantity of the rice served with it.

Service was quick, and the ambience pleasant. Our bill came up to Rs 1281.",positive

But let me directly go to the food. The quality of food was awesome. We ordered panko prawn (a fried prawn dish ) and chicken mono as starters. I really liked the prawn dish. Prawn was fresh and fried to perfection. Next came the main dishes e.g. Spicy Coriander Rice , Butter noodles and Kung Pau chicken. Spicy Coriander rice is the signature dish and a must try. The smell of fresh coriander coming out of moderately spicy rice was mouthwatering.   I have not had such a nice fried rice in recent times. Kung Pau chicken was soft and juicy. Butter noodles melted inside mouth. The amount of prawn and chicken in the mixed noodles was generous. We had Darshan ( Chinese Wonton Strips ) as desert.

Cheer up for Christmas, as Stadel brings in to you some of the lovely cakes which got kicked off with a beautiful cake mixing ceremony a couple of days ago. A moment of joy, frolic and happiness, this is one occasion where everyone gathers in, and helps out by pouring in liquor and juices on top of a huge assortment of nuts and dry fruits.

The entire atmosphere gets filled in with the aroma of the liquor and creates almost a mesmerized effect and trance upon those present. Swirl, twist and carefully ripple through your hands within the mixture and combine them as many times as you can for the liquid to be really soaked inside as deeply and finely as possible!

This mixture will then be stored under appropriate conditions, wherein it would get fermented to produce some lovely outputs before Christmas and New Year kicks in!

Chowpatty Chatpata- named after the famous Chowpatty beach in Mumbai. The fries tasted good and served in cute mini toy truck which is really an eye catcher.

Oreo Pakoda - this was something unusual which was served with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream on top. I tasted for the first time and it tasted amazing.

Mint Alepino- fries mixed with tangy mint jalapeño sauce. The fries were fresh and crispy too.

We ordered three things in our thaali.

Butter Naan- Soft and tasty, had balanced amount of jeera that contributed to the taste. Liked it, but it ain't the best naan of my life.
Palak paneer- Creamy and delicious. Had abundant amount of paneer in it, moderately spicy and it did melt in my mouth. I did customize it with the lemon ,salt and chilli provided along with the dish, because I love spicy foods. I highly recommend it.

Bundi Raita- Again creamy and delicious, bundi was crunchy . It was a little less salty but I used the salt provided according to my taste preferences. I loved this too.

Now coming to taste, the Reshmi kebab was a big let down. The pieces were stiff, over cooked and the spices not properly infused. But the Tangri kebab was shockingly wonderful. The biriyani was also good but a bit oily for some people's liking.

We had Plain Dosas and Cold Coffee here. Dosas were good and so was the coffee. However, the sugar could have been ground more. But nothing much to complain, given the rate.
The staff were polite and the meal was hearty and fulfilling.",positive

Had Gnochhi and Insalata Caesar Salad.
Gnocchi was amazing.Potato pasta with sundried tomatoes and basil,bursting with flavours.
The Insalata Caesar Sald was the best Caesar Salad I ever had,topped with Goat cheese.
Pinch in the pocket is very high ,but so is the food quality.

The homemade breads they serve serve complimentary was a real treat.The buns are soft and  baked to perfection,served with butter.A second visit is worthy on account of their breads alone.",positive

easy to locate, just beside the quest mall..

first things first, the ambience and the staff service deserves and extra point.. the cafe certainly manages to look classy.. have been on restaurants where the service was delayed or not attended properly, bit here it was way too good inspite of being crowded..

talking about the food, the mushrooms we ordered tasted not like we expected it to be.. but all the rest of the items (photos attached) alongwith butter naan and paneer butter masala was great in taste and quality..

reasonable prices..

if you're a vegan, and want to head somewhere to fill your stomach right after roaming around that extra expensive mall on the opposite side of the road, then this place is for you :)",positive

The rice was not cooked properly in all the dishes though the beef was cooked properly. The sauted vegetables in the steak was a bit hard as well. Cheesy fries tasted amazing though, we asked for tobasco sauce with the fries and it tasted amazing with the sauce.The chefs should definitely taste the food before serving.
Apart from that everything was pretty much good, the satffs were friendly as well and the pocket pinch was reasonable.",negative

It's a very small eatery with just one table arranged outside. Basically it's a delivery place. The prices are quite reasonable. We ordered the chicken crispy spring roll. But we were served with veg spring rolls. On complaining to the staff, they agreed to our complaints and agreed that it indeed was a veg one. So they need to upgrade their service. I was equally dissapointed with the quality of the spring roll. It was too oily and did not taste as good. The only good thing was the dip served along with it. They really need to up their standards to attract a crowd. Although I am sure the other items would be better. Hope to try them sometime.",negative

MENU : They are currently providing puja special thali so all ala carte items are out of stock.
FOOD: Among the drinks aam panna was very refreshing. The mangsher bora & chicken kebabs were very good though the bora was a tad bit dry. The cholar dal, chana monohara, & alu fulkopir torkari was light & flavoursome alongside a little bland pulao. The chicken kosha & mutton Biryani was regular.

Coming to the food, we ordered a basket of fries and red sauce pasta. They were both good, but the fries needed salt, and one drawback of ordering the pasta was that it got cold quickly in the weather. Unfortunately I don't see visiting smoke Shack in summers due to the Kolkata heat, so this seasonal problem has to be dealt with.
The staff was courteous and professional. The cost is around 800/head without alcohol.
Ultimately a winner.",positive

This place, Litti Inbox, does both, has tradi3littis as well as fusion and fancy ones. I got them delivered from here and so am commenting in the delivery order. The classic litti that we ordered came accompanied with potato chokha and baigan bharta accompanied with two tangy sauces. The packing was excellent.

We had so much tasty and well seasoned food with authentic spices and ghee and oil being used in the correct amount, one could taste the flavour of each dish even after eating spoonfuls.
The view of Ganga flowing by as we ate added to the charm of the food and the ambience which in this case is unmatched in all Kolkata and/or throughout India.

The Quantity was insane. The food was more than enough for two of us. Each and every dish tasted great. The rice was loaded generously with egg, chicken, shrimps and pork. The Chilly Pork was the best as it had a very low proportion of fat to meat.

3640,"I happened to order some food from this restaurant on one of my evening visit to my friend's place. It is basically a delivery joint located in Sulekha and my friend suggested me to try some of their food items. We tried out the following items:

1. Schezwan Mixed Hakka Noodles
2. Tsing Hoi Chicken
3. Singapore Fried Rice
4. Schezwan Fish
5. Thai Veg Curry

All the preparation was equally good. I specially liked the Schezwan mixed Hakka Noodles which was on the spicier side as per my liking. The Tsing hoi chicken is also something which went pretty well with the Noodles and the fried rice. It tastes best when served hot. Thanks to swiggy for the same. Also the Thai curry was a surprise. Made with mushroom and babycorn, this is definitely one of the best veg dish tried out by me. I would definitely love to try their other dishes too. This place is highly recommended. Also the prices here are pretty reasonable and it wont burn a whole in your pocket.",positive

It's a bit inside the bylane towards gariahat pantaloons but it's worth the effort.",positive

It serves a lavish buffet with a wide range of options for all age group people to gorge upon.
From decor to ambience to staff behaviour everything is picture perfect.

The starters included both veg and non veg items along with a variety of salad. They even had live pasta counter.

The main course too serves both veg and non veg items. Vegetarian people can get a lot of options to try from. The non veg items were the highlight of the buffet. Starting from Chicken biriyani to mutton kasa to chilly chicken to fish, it had everything which was required for a non veg lover to satisfy their souls.

The desert section was also quite impressive. It had pastries, gulab jamun, malpua, baked roshogolla. The deserts were too good at the end.

Like many other new restaurants in the southern avenue/ sarat bose road region, this nice eatery has also decently decorated the interior like an old building. Food was awesome. Golden baby corn and chicken nuggets are the items I loved the most. I also loved their mojito. As per main course, I along with my girlfriend tried chicken stroganoff and factory mixed sizzler. Stroganoff was good (but I liked stroganoff more that was served in Trincas), sizzler was also decent (may be because we were almost full while having this 😝).

This food joint severs some delicious quick snack options like momos, chicken lollipos and noodles etc.

I have been a fan of their momos for a long time now and can also say that all other items are decent and taste good.

The only drawback is that there is no proper sitting area so you'll have to struggle a little while you're holding the hot plate in one hand and eating with the other. Also there's no obstruction of the roadside dust so all the pollution from the vehicles and the dust can be problem for some.",positive

We had Watermelon and Basil Mojitos, Classic Caesar Salad, Lamb Chops, Grilled Bhetki with Garlic Butter Sauce, Cheese and Keema Stuffed Chicken Steak and last but not the least Cheese Fondue.

I am a pure vegetarian and what was delivered to me was Chicken Biriyani, I was furious,  I called the hotel, he says, it is impossible on his part to have sent the wrong order and put the entire blame on the delivery guy, saying he had mulitple orders from the shop, hence he might have mixed up, while the delivery guy in return claimed that it was just 1 order from that shop so the question of mix up doesnt arise.

From their selection of finest food, Crispy chilli baby corn and hariyali chicken Tikka were superb to start off with. In the mains, the aromatic Kashmiri pulao went really well with the rich and sumptuous currys like Saagwali Mutton and Murgh Irani. Salads and accompaniments of various sorts were great as well.

1. Chicken hot and sour soup (5/5): Really yummy in taste.

2. Mushroom soup ( 3.5/5): Watery and very bland in taste

3. Chicken steam momo (4.5/5): Delicious. But the size of the momos served were smaller than previous occassions. Also, the chutney served was a bit more salty than reqd.

4. Chilly dry fish (4.5/5): Good quality and taste. The amount of veggies can however be increased.

5. Mushroom hakka chowmein (4.5/5): Taste wise very good but it needs to reduce the oil content . Also, there is some problem with the quality of prawns used.Need to work on that else it is good.

6. Hot garlic chicken (4.5/5): Tasty

I don't know from which angle it looks like biriyani. There was no minimum fragrance of biriyani. You clearly will understand that they cooked the biriyani with some ready made biriyani masala which we can get in every grocery shop. Don't know how tasty the other cuisine are of this outlet but it was my first order from here and they ruined it totally. I ordered after checking the zomato rating so never expected this. Also the price is a bit high. Don't go for biriyani ever from it.

The assorted kebab platters is an amazing offer for two, as you can try at least three varieties of kebabs(fish tikka, chicken tikka and reshmi kebab) at extremely cheap rates.
The Biryani portion is humongous and it can be a waste if you take one plate for each person.
The Mutton Hanglabari is a compulsory try.

Since we are celebrating a birthday, they went out of their way to make the day extra special.

10123,"In a nutshell: When all else fails, go to ek drink!

Shady ambience, terrible food, loud Bollywood numbers, non courteous staff and cheap alcohol are the appropriate adjectives.

Even though the service and food is below average, one might think that it’s a great place for cheap thrills, but trust me it’s not! Their strategy is to provide cheap alcohol with expensive food platters that you will regret eating! :(

Advice: Visit this place just for the alcohol, not the food!",negative

Had ordered Chicken Momo, Chinese Chicken Chopsuey, Egg Chicken Pan Fried Noodle, Sweet Garlic Chicken Gravy.

New Market is probably the Roll hub of Calcutta.This place always comes with surprises,and never lets anyone to forget the charm and pleasantness.
Heritage Karco used to be one of the most happening bar & restaurant of its surroundings.Evenings were full of cheers and jubilation.Tunes of popular songs would emanate from the inside.Another distinguishing feature of this place was the finest Kathi Rolls.But as the time passed,it has lost much of the glory of its heydays.The only silver lining that remained is their rolls,which still amazes and triggers nostalgia.

2. MUTTON KOSHA - Initially we were unhappy but when we complained about the pieces, they changed it and gave us pieces which was full of meat. Leaving that everything was fine and you will love the taste.

3. LACHCHA PARATHA - Well made. Crunchy and soft at the same time.

4. ALUR DAM - It was beautifully made and we loved it.

Give it a try and don't forget to go without using discounts.

Packed to perfection,while i opened the containers,my nostrils just dived into the authentic Chinese flavours. The Kung Pao Fish was so salivating,it had boneless Basa chunks battered and fried,tossed in to kung Pao sauce and cashews. Oh it is worth a try.
The fried rice had Egg and chicken stips while the Garlic Chicken was on the Sweeter Side. The generous quantity of Garlic present in the gravy complimented the chicken to perfection. Fried Rice was good,maybe a little more quantity can do wonders. Still,Pocket Pinch being on the lower side the order was just perfect.

Raita had been good but too spicy to be balanced with the flavour of biryani.

Though it cannot be placed among the first class, top-quality biryanis produced by some of the well-known restaurants in the city (like Oudh 1590, Arsalan or even Dum Pukht at ITC Sonar), or some other low-key popular places (Besstoo, Kabuliwala, @49) that serve some really tasty biryanis, the chicken tikka biryani from The Great Biryani Co. had nonetheless been quite appetising and delivered in more than sufficient quantity to whet one's appetite.",positive

We ordered a Latte, The famous Java Chip Frappéchino, and a Red Velvet & orange cake. The total bill was ~850.
I got the Frappéchino for myself and honestly I've never had such pathetic drink (basically a cold coffee) before. It costed around 300 and was full of crushed ice and very bland in taste.
The only star was the red velvet cake 😍 if i ever visit them again it would only be for that cake. All in all money wasted. 😒",negative

The fried rice was neither too dry nor too oily. Was freshly made and had the right flavours of a good Chinese fried rice. The quantity was enough for a hungry glutton.
The chilli chicken was well cooked too. Right tinge of spice and tang. A no nonsense Kolkata Chinese that we bongs adore.
Ordering soon again.",positive
9497,Received the delivery of my dinner order. Delivery was just in time and food quality is good. I had some issues with the 🐔 curry.

Ordered from this outlet from Foodpanda, chicken burger at Rs 19/-.
Firstly,never thought the burger could be delivered to me so fast.

3247,"This place has already proved that ""outward judgement often fails"". We are actually overwhelmed with their mouth watering delicacy. This fusion Bengali restaurant is lying at 359, J BLOCK, B.P TOWNSHIP, GARIA, KOLKATA, exactly near about PATULI floating market. This cobby place mainly considers delivery or take away but they wielded a seating classification of hardly 12 people. Service was so good and prompt. Staffs were really taking good care of our assertion.

This restaurant is mainly unfolded from the house of ""BARAANDA"" and it serves some spiffy palatable dishes to us.

A glimpse of the sapid items we ordered:

1) CHEESY FISH FINGER 125/-
2) STEAMED RICE 40/-
3) MOROLA MACHER BATI CHORCHORI 100/-

Yes the Entry is a little bit shabby, but no one cares. Went there with Friends.
Ordered A Cheese Babycorn Masala
Egg Chicken Cheese Dosa and a simple Egg Chicken Dosa. They were absolutely delicious. From the crunch to the amount of Stuffing inside, the Dosas were mindblowing. WoW, Will visit again.

10383,"Very Peaceful and Calm restaurant. If you want to hangout with your friends or alone then this a good choice for natives . Although it's a small restaurant many families come here for a peaceful lunch or dinner or simply a lite dinner . Moreover an unique feature is that they have open air seating arrangement with a old Bengali theme which is absolute perfect for Adda.
Now coming to the which is basically Bengali and Chinese cuisine. There are lots of special Bengali thali which is really upto the mark. In the Chinese section one of the most preferred item is Chicken Momos which is really delicious and healthy. The Chinese items like fries rice and chili chicken are also highly sold items in this shop . Of you're finding a good restuarant in a reasonable rate them you must have a try....... Thank You",positive
3649,"The packing of the food is wonderful. However, they labelled the vegetarian burger as the non vegetarian burger and vice versa. Therefore, had I not been attentive, I would have had the wrong one.

We ordered the Cottage House Mafia and the Chika Licka Burger, along with french fries. The french fries were decently good. They were crisp and weren't soggy. Although, they were a little thicker.

The burgers tasted great. The smell of the burger when you open the packet ticks the right boxes and makes you want to jump in. I wish there were a few more pickled gherkins inside, which would add a twist to the taste.

I can see myself ordering from this place again, whenever I am in the mood for burgers. I hope they don't make the same mistake again.",positive

Though I am not a big fan of South Indian Cuisine , but United Cafe is what comes to my mind, when I think of South Indian Cuisine in Kolkata. I have been quite a few times here. It's a small and congested place. The service is the quickest of all. Dosa , Butter Onion Masala Uthapam and Aloo vada is their speciality. The Dosa is crispy outside with soft inside and aloo masala . The chutney served is fresh, having a distinct flavour of coconut and curry leaves. Uthappam and Aloo vada is a must try. If your taste buds demands South Indian flavour at Behala, it's United Cafe at the most reasonable price.",positive
4661,"Been to this place recently to try out their awesome cuisine. This is located just above Sumo Dough on the same building near Bhawanipore Education Society. The ambiance of this place is really cool with great seating and private dining spaces. This is one of the few place in that area that serves Shisha

We ordered 
Hungary Chicken ₹285
Toblerorone Shake ₹245
Fish Florentine ₹445
Hookah ₹295
Chocolate Cheesecake ₹225

The good part of this place is you can order from the menu card of Kath Koyla and Sumo Dough. 
The toblerone shake really stands out and the best i have tried. Don’t miss out on the Fish Florentine. Its one of their best dishes. 
Overall a great ambiance to enjoy with your friends. Looking forward to visit again",positive

3513,One of my favourites in my locality. They serve both mughlai and chinese cuisine but I will recommend to try their chinese. I have tried almost all of their chinese items and I would say it has never disappointed me. Both the quality and quantity of food is very good. Their best preparation is schezwan chicken. They have such a popularity in our locality that the biriyani they cook only lasts for 1 hour only due to the demand.,positive
7969,A solid 3.5/5 for this roadside eatery! After completing our work at JU we decided to grab a quick lunch from an eatery nearby.

When the restaurant personnel came himself to deliver, he made me go all the way to our housing gate, and refused to make a doorstep delivery. I had paid by Paytm upfront, so I had to sort of put up with it.

Finally, they decided to send less portion of paneer , and instead of 8 pieces, they gave 6.

#ChristmasDiaries

I had heard about this place long back but couldn't manage to drop in till a couple of days ago..

Beautiful decor portraying the works of one and only #SatyajitRay and serving a variety of continental delicacies - it greets you with an old world charm the moment you step in..

I had very little time in hand and not much of an appetite since I had gone for a meeting - thought of settling down with a dessert and thank God I did so..

This #CaramelCustard was one of the best that you get in town specially bcz of the cream that it is topped with unlike anywhere else I have had it till date - makes it an even more delicious affair indeed.. Would love to go back soon to try out the remaining delicacies on the menu..

My humble two cents: #MUSTTRY

5401,"Ordered the chicken thali.

I was really disappointed with everything in the thali!

The rice had something greenish in it. It tasted weird.
The paratha wasn't even a paratha, just a fried roti. It was so hard I couldn't chew it, had to throw it away.
The chicken curry's gravy didn't taste good.
The dal was watery.
Instead of a gulab jamun they gave sooji.
The only decent item was the veg item.

The thali also gave me loose motion!

10649,"To start with this outlet serves the worst pizza ever. The pizza base wasn't baked properly and the paid extra cheese was too cheap to be genuine, we felt it had flour mixed in it and to top it all the topping was disastrously done. We had ordered for crispy chicken too, I think the outlet has mistaken it for serving us with hard crust and the chicken inside being the chewing gum!! Seriously you guys had ruined our taste buds for that day! Worst experience. Won't order ever from 'Bengal pizza'. Packaging was also not up to mark.",negative

But it is always crowded by zomato delivery boys which prove that it is a hit ...iv ordered from here several number of times coz they provide a seating arrangement for max 8 people.. Its a small joint but the chicken combos n buckets are better than any of its contemporary.. 
The chicken breast n leg pieces are huge n more than  enough for one.. 
Chicken wings are the best from in here 
I personally like popcorn chicken (with a justifiable quantity) 
Burgers are equally good 
Not to forget surprisingly the french fries are real crispy.. 
Final verdict : a must try if you are craving for some lip smacking fried chicken but broke at the same time ..",negative

There is hardly any place to seat, moreover due to its location it becomes difficult to have to food while standing in that busy footpath.
The food quality isn't good yet and in that price. They just taste little better then and footpath shops. The egg Chowmine is marked at Rs.70 for a full plate, is not at all Worthy and same for the other dishes.
There are much better places nearby offering good food at cheaper rate. Not much recommend.

But one thing that should be improve from my end that please increase your stocks of beers and increase your collection of scotch and imported whisky. Because it wasn't upto the mark. So please look into this matter.

As suggested by the book it ritualistically makes 65 Prawn Cutlets everyday and yes it does run out in no time, so be there or be square. Most of the dishes are made with Pure Ghee and despite being heavy Oily dishes they manage to cook it miraculously in a very light manner which some of the cafes and restaurants in that area fail to do so. The Fish Cutlet was equally good along with the Chicken Steak, so simple yet so tasty, all cooked in pure ghee. I am definitely going back for more to try out everything else in the menu but in installments and so should one.",positive

Quantity of rice was good for one, But the dal and sabji given was flavourless! Absolutely worthless.

Chutney was watery and too sweet. Absolutely not value for money! This shit costs ₹225. Dont even try to order from here , one will get better options in this price. They did not even send a spoon or napkin with it, even though we asked for it.

The shikanji was well made and so was the dahi papdi chaat. The mango kulfi is innovative to the core and quite literally so as they take the malai kulfi and stuff it onto slices of mango in a way that you get both in each bite.

Brown Chow(3/5) : it tastes same like Hakka noodles, but on a sweeter side. I liked this item.

Kaptai Soup(1/5) :This is pork organ soup. This item is not bad but it has a strong smell, which is unbearable. I personally didn't liked it .

Ambience - Chilled air conditioning, dimly lit with a miniature howrah bridge dividing the restro in two halves, and a separate bar counter and a great playlist. All you need to chillax.

Service - People are prompt but order delivery is slower than usual, but as they say ""fruit of patience is sweet"". Rate - 4/5.

Verdict - The food tasted great #GREAT and that is most important for me. My people loved the ambience and the music. I would have loved it if the service was faster. By the way they do not have an inhouse washroom, which is a great turndown.

4415,We visited this iconic place on our trip to Kolkata. Had heard a lot about it and it totally was worth it . Tried the chicken stew with toast . It was a complete meal for one person. The fish roll was delicious. Our favourite was the diamond fish . Totally value for money.,positive
817,"Just think if you can have a full sized meal inside the submarine a 1000 feet under the sea .
Well if not the original submarine, you can go and visit kouzina marine to have kinda similar experience . I have to admit they have made a superb work not missing out any of the smaller details which will blow your mind away .

Anyways now coming to the food we had
✓ Sherly temple
✓ desi style quinoa
✓ cheese burst mushrooms
✓ veg biryani
✓ chocolate roll

Each and every items were just delicious. I loved the mocktail as well as the cheese burst mushrooms . Both are must try. And the biriyani was also great.

Overall though you don't like having vegetarian foods , you must try the place . I'm sure they will turn the way how you look upon vegetarian dishes .",positive
3323,"This restaurant has a homely feel. The moment one steps inside, a waitress greets us with a warm ""Moshi Moshi"". The best part is the sitting arrangement - - a small section where one can sit by folding their legs beneath themselves, just like at home. We ordered two cosmopolitans and tori momo. The drinks were nicely made. However, I personally didn't like their toris. The worst part is that they charged an extra 10% service charge, even after charging us 5% GST.",negative

Now coming to the most important aspect - taste, must say I was little bit surprised when tasted their biriyani. I may not say its heart melting - out of the world taste, but its surely delectable, delicious, pleasing to your taste buds and enjoyable. Plus a very good quantity as well.

Now its been more than five time i have ordered biriyani, salad from Zoya just because of taste. If you want to have a pocket friendly decent taste lunch/dinner, then Zoya Biriyani would be best option in north kolkata.",positive

Talking about the ambience and decor it always reminds me of my city Lucknow where we have the nawabi essence all over the city, though we cannot find it here all over the city but ofcourse in Oudh we do. The wooden carvings, the coloured glass panels those Thalis in which people eat and in nawabi style it's called taslas reminds me of Lucknow.

The restaurant is also decorated by the fish net all around which makes the ambience different.
We ordered the below: 
Sea food coriander soup - first few spoons I liked it but after that the smell of seafood like oysters , snails 🐌 became monotonous and feel like foul smell.
Steamed gondhoraj bhetki - its a fusion of indian and continental dish... i liked it but again after having half portion, I found the taste very blunt. May be being a bengali, we always crave for proper spicy মাছ এর item.
Ilish combo - My husband ordered it. The ilish bhapa came along with steamed rice with ghee, daal and begun bhaja.
This combi is a perfect lunch menu for any bengali. He loved it. 
Overall a new experience. But I suggest if this pace also serves few chicken and mutton items, it would be better as many of us doesn't like fish that much but go together to spend some quality time with friends and family.",negative

They will force u to take mineral water with costs around 30-35/- . Awfully late service and when the food arrived it was not even warm. The paneer was dry and chewy so was the chicken and also of very small pieces. Very very thin tandoori rotis and chewy too. A total waste of money.

• Shanghai noodle
The Shanghai noodles was spicy hence I loved it
Rice dishes were good nothing exceptional.

. We tried Padkimao Noodles, the spicier version with soy sauce, Thai chilli paste and holy basil... Also their mushroom was silky with an awesome texture.. The other dish was jade noodles which was green noodles flavoured with spring greens and garlic.. This was the more subtle of the lot and was docile in its appeal...

1229,"Although this comes from someone who's a big fan of themed restaurants,a big 5 for a restro is always an achievement when it's about the finest details... although my insides are killing me for a 4.5 option...but still this restro deserves an applause not only for sticking to the theme...but also maintaining the act throughout the dishes they serve whether it's the absolutely flavourful kebabs or the breads or the platters or the attire of the staff...to the point one entirely leaves the restro... Afghani rugs provide the necessary warmth helped on by the ambient lighting...and the entire stay is a complete dining experience. Therefore, it has driven me to say that it is a much needed oasis in the desert full of 'themed' restro mirages.",positive

I visited this place a week ago and I was really impressed seeing the dishes made with eggs. They can be a very good breakfast option.
A biryani joint serving delicious egg dishes are very very rare.

On my visit with my friends I tried out the,
•Tandoori Egg
•Scrambled Egg with bread
•Supper fluffy egg
•Devil's Egg
•Baked Egg

I would highly recommend the Baked Egg.
Also I tried out some kebabs like the Prawn kebab, Tangri Kebab.
For the main course I took the Chicken Tikka Biryani.

Kolkata is famous for kathi rolls, here I tried out the Chicken roll and Paneer Roll here.

Everything prepared really well. It's a super affordable place so you can visit here on a weekly basis too.",positive

We found the seating very comfortable and the music sublime and suiting to the ambience. Would love to go again.

The did customised the fish starter on our request.

Asked a few people at the station and reached this non descript place - 3 minutes walk from Belghoria local station. 

The place was clean and well kept. First thing you notice about them is the crowd- takeaway food. This place is what you could describe as ""parar hotel"", mostly catering to the PG residents that thrive in the station area. 

Now , coming to the food. The order was confirmed swiftly. Specific instruction was given to make it absolutely minimal spicy. 

The chicken was nicely made. However, it seems the particular request fell on deaf ears. The gravy was made over the top spicy and generous amount of chilly slices were visible everywhere. 

Made things really hard for both of us, somehow we managed.

Also, there is no parking space and the outlet is bang on a very busy traffic signal. So ppl are forced to park far far away and walk from there.
Even the staircase within the property scares me coz one needs to carry a tray(s) full of food up and down the stairs and they re steep and winding. Someone is (or already has) bound to drop it all there. Plus this outlet becomes completely non 'disabled-friendly' for the aforementioned reasons.

It was served with the red chilly and green chutney and also clear soup garnished with parsley. It tasted well and is a must try.

Recommended to order at home, rather than visiting the place.",negative

Good food..
You can mainly deliver at your place..
Had masala dosa there..
It was good..

The space is real jammed up. Its a small cozy place with air-conditioning and 2to levels. The ambience simple. Service average.

Coming to the food this is a joint for the budget goers and keeping that in mind the price at which they offer its quite good. The main courses, fried rice and noodles was quite good. Though the hakka noodles tasted a bit blunt. The szechwan chowmein was tear dripping spicy.

The side dished were average. Chicken pieces were well sized but lacked the juices inside. The suaces were well cooked. Overall a budget friendly place to dig in some chinese dishes.",negative

All of them was tasty and fulfilled our craving . The fish finger was made with soft marinated fish with a crispy coating and adequately fried. Single plate of rice was perfect for two and the side dishes were perfectly prepared with adequate gravy and 8pieces of chicken/fish. The pocket pinch was also satisfying for us.",positive

We followed up by ordering the spaghetti aglio e olio (excellent), a margherita pizza (also good, and the thinness of the crust was appreciated) and a chicken tetrazzine (nice and rich, but not cloying).

The taste made up for it to some extent. The pork was well fried, was crisp, and went well with the dip they provided with it. However, 170 bucks for a handful of medium sized pork pieces, merely fried with no distinct seasoning whatsoever, is not justified. And there was quite a lot of pork fat as well in place of meat. Not a memorable experience.",negative

You can get hot dogs, sandwiches, pastries etc. If your looking for a cafe with beer then this place can provide you that. 7-8 people can be seated at once. The decor and ambiance is nothing wow. A quite gloomy dark place. We ordered a double decker non veg sandwich. It came with chips. A very moderate sandwich. And they should add new items to the menu",negative

The food here was good.i felt not exceptionally good but year not bad either.Thus im going with 3.5 stars.We had their special latt-me-kai dish which was kind of a starter and it was good,little spicy which we wanted.One thing i dint like about this dish was that it was full of chopped garlic.but anyways it was overall tasty.
Then we had pan fried chicken noodles which also had mushrooms in it.The pan fried noodles were good but as they said it was their specialty i dint find it to be exceptional again.Infact latt me kai was better.The noodles were not fried properly aswell.

However, if you order without looking on the right side of the menu, you will surely get a heart attack upon getting the cheque served to you. The pizza was tasting good until i realized that its worth more than 500 and the only topping it had was of cheese, tomato sauce and some tiny pieces of chicken here and there along with droplets of feta. Similar experience was with my plain white sauce pasta (costing about 350), which not even had basic veggies and was topped only with chicken, where the chicken add-on costed about 75, making the total cost to about 425 (just plain white sauce pasta and little pieces of chicken with no veggies). C'mon guys, that price is fair only if your dish has other veggies as topping too, e.g. olives, onion, capsicum, jalapenos and corns.",negative

We opted for the buffet for around 14 people. It had a nice ambience and a great seating arrangement for us. Hassle free scheduling for prior booking. As the name suggests it was based on the Zodiac theme.

Initially we were served a combo of ""5 element of nature"" and that was quite unique. Later we had the starter with a complimentary drinks (non-alcoholic). The starters had a wide variety with some preparations which I never had before. Mushroom balls, chilly fish, chicken Tikka are few which I loved the most.

One can get a heritage feeling having food here as this is a very old restaurant and small open cabins are also there.

I have ate here many times. On last visit me and my partner took mutton fried rice and mixed fried rice and a quarter of boneless chilly chicken and a plate of green salad.

Basically this is a hall on the ground floor of a tourist lodge,where the boarders and outsiders have their meals.The speciality lies in the menu,which keeps changing everyday to avoid monotony.Typical Bengali items cooked with a homely feel is their USP.Being a pice hotel,none comes here for a dazzling interior design or nobody expects a romantic atmosphere.What wins over the foodies is simplicity submerged in the unique savour.

The spaghetti dish tated really nice but I doubt whether they have used the spaghetti pasta or not, considering the thickness of the noodles. The place can be visited for a second time to have food but the hospitality needs to be improved and the staffs there need to take a serious lesson to deal with their behavior.",positive

The staffs have always been courtesious and quantity and quality of food is always been up to the same quality. Red wine chicken is my favorite dish in this place. Another one is egg burnt garlic rice. One plate of any dish is sufficient for two people here and quality is also good.,positive

The dishes are also presented very well.
We tried:
1)Bhaji Pav Mastani- This was accompanied with a full loaf of bun btead,with butter,onions and a painter's brush toh apply the butter on your Pav. The bhaji tasted amazing. Though it is a bit pricey as far as I think.

Sambar was not good .But the coconut chutney was fair .And the dosa was not appropriate to the term .The service offered by the zomato person was fast .Packaging was good .

And we had absolutely no idea that veg rolls can be so tasty. Price is also very reasonable.We tried few items mentioned below-

● Baked pizza roll- Had pizza toppings inside it and lots of cheese. (Personal favourite)

● Paneer kathi roll- paneer was soft and the roll was very flavourful. Liked it too.

● Peri peri twister- I had tried the twister before, but this potato twister was crunchy and flavourful as well.

● Bhoot jolokiya roll- It was the spiciest roll I have ever tried.we had to take coke to finish it. So think twice before placing your order.

● Nutella banana roll- banana pieces with nutella . Though I didn't like the combo that much.

So roll it out is one kind of fusion roll centres and they have done a great job so far.",positive

Food items: Ordered mixed noodles and chili chicken for dinner. Two mixed noodles is enough for three. The chili chicken is a farce in the name of chili chicken. The coating is extremely thick and the gravy tastes like a thick broth of tomato juice and vegetables floating around. 

The noodles is full of black pepper and black pepper only. It rarely had any taste.",negative

Again I visited this branch and tried spicy chicken wrap which cost only 80 rupees. A soft bread roll stuffed with enough chicken, salad and mayo sauce and the bite you get is really mouthgasmic.

We ordered babycorn item as starter, masala kulcha, Kashmiri polao, navratan korma, paneer butter masala, malai kofta and paneer jalfrezi. All the recipes worth of praises. First, the food was delivered in time. Foods were up to the mark in taste. The only problem I had was - the delivery guy did not have enough cash to exchange my payment. Anyway, we sorted it out somehow.
So, in nutshell, I liked the service and quality of foods from zomato and Marwar respectively. Hence the high rating...",positive
4134,"This place was on my wishlist for long. The last time there was no ilish mach available but this time thankfully I got to try their Ilish Bhapa. It was very well prepared. I think they should not limit their ilish dishes to bhapa. They should also introduce other dishes of ilish in online ordering.
I had also ordered papad and plain rice. I would have liked it more if rice was basmati.
Prices are fair. Overall it was a pleasant experience.",positive
10088,"Went there for a weekday lunch. Found a lot of things on the menu with south Indian priority, but not necessarily. So decided to go for a full thali @ Rs 110/- (theres also a mini thali which doesnt include Poori @ Rs 90/-) Got 3 pooris, sambhar, aloo dry sabzi (the one used in masala dosa filling), 2 papads, butter milk, sheera, rice and a white kadhi which reminded me of Gujarati style sweet kadhi.   

The taste of food is average, but fresh. I expected atleast a rasam and one more veggie to go with the rice and poori. Anyways, its not disappointing either, as rates are reasonable. Its a busy street eatery and basic in approach. One of those few places in strand road where you can sit, order and be served a peaceful meal. I will go again to try dosas and other south Indian items.",negative

1968,"A highly pocket friendly place to have a bite. I like the Chinese cuisine here. We had drums of heaven, fish finger and the Chinese combo. It was extremely filling. The sitting is of moderate quality and service is minimal but fast. They won't have you waiting for your food.

I had Dairy dark waffle over here and it was so chocolaty and so delicious. Golden waffle stuffed with milk chocolate and topped with a big kf dark chocolate. This is a must try here.

The only dissapoinment I have regarding this place is, once I ordered Nutella waffle from this place via zomato and the waffles were delivered soggy and cold. This wasn't expected.

Overall, this place has come up with some great variants of waffle and each and every waffles here are worth a try.",negative

At the entrance of this restaurant you'll see a monkey seating in a bench entering, you'll see a elephant raising it's trunk, hear a lion's roar, live waterfall if you go to a little close proximity you'll see crocodiles, tortoises and a number of wild animals! Stairs are made up of tree's trunk and they looks so real! Now, coming to the food, among the starter we had Malai chicken tikka kebab along with sweet lime soda, both were mouth melting. Then, we ordered chicken dum biriyani along with Afghani chicken masala both complemented each other so well. Ended our meal at a sweet note with a kulfi! Service was good and quick too.

Coming to the food, the starters had quite a number of varieties in kebabs sections and all were pretty well made and delicious. What was special about the starters were the two chinese starters they were simply mind blowing and you cannot resist asking for more. Then the main course had a number of varieties both in chinese and indian, veg and non veg. They were pretty good. Specially the rice items and the mutton side. The desserts have a huge number of variety and i promise by the time you reach the desserts section you would regret having just one stomach to fit in all the gluttony.
Apart from the food, the hosts were wonderful. They would always be there asking for your reviews and are always ready to help you. There was also a complimentary drink. Overall i would super recommend this buffet.",positive

The food spread looked interesting but the problem started when we asked for the starters to be served on the table. The staff kept on serving 1 each of veg & non veg item where as there were 4 starters. On asking, the staff kept on asking for more time. We had to wait for 35 mins to get fish fry. When asked the duty manager, he had no answers.. The food spread at the buffet was cold & there was no proper refill inspite of repeated reminders. This type of service (only 4 tables were occupied including ours) is totally not acceptable. We would expect the management to give a logical reply to the above faux pas. A strict No No from my side..",negative

It's a big cafe with 2 storeys, one for dining and the storey above they have turned into a beautiful lounge with a huge screen and few booths even where you can enjoy hookah. Each booth has separate game stations which is really incredible and unique.
Coming to food, we tried a Cheese Omlet and their signature HURRICANE.
The cheese omlet was soft and succulent, served with fried potato mash and boiled tomato. The egg tasted good.
The Hurricane was a tangy drink, served wonderfully as you can see in the picture.
Overall a nice experience and would love to visit again.",positive

5909,"A decades old eatery that serves very good Bengali food cooked by Oriya & Bengali ‘Thakur’s.
Mangovind Ponda from Odisha started this hotel in Kolkata in 1927 in the name of ‘Hindu Hotel’. Being a youth leader, #netajisubhaschandrabose was its regular food-eater. Not only had that, several freedom fighters, including Rishi Aurobindo, lunch and dinner here. Not only did they indulge in its amazing delicacies, but they also hid here during their revolution. Post independence, the name was changed to its present one on January 25. Even today, this hotel teems with Bengali customers, everyday.
""Swadhin Bharat"" means #independentindia ... That talks about the time when this restaurant opened.
Water was served in bhar (kulhar / earthen pot).
Food was served on banana leaf atop steel plate.
One of our old tradition remains through such wonderful hotels in the city.",positive

I already have prior experiences of their hospitality in other cities, which is one of the best in our country for sure and they lived up to my expectation this time too. The lunch buffet spread was outstanding, with amazing variety and superb taste and presentation. The staff is so helpful and courteous that it makes the experience of dining much more supreme. The icing on the cake (pun intended) was the complimentary yummy birthday cake they offered. Truly an experience worth remembering.",positive

The ambience and the friendliness of the staff was very comforting. Especially their staff called Ria made an excellent hostess.

Ordered half rack of bbq pork rib and the chicken burrito.

The burrito was good to taste and was thoroughly enjoyed. However, the rib could use a little more time in the heat as the meat was just short of falling off the bone. Taste wise the rib was decent. The mashed potato had a few lumps in it and I even got a few bits of potato peel in my mouth while eating. Could be much better.",negative

Going through the positive reviews, I thought of giving a try and I am glad that I tried. I ordered an egg chicken fried rice and hot garlic chicken.
The quantity of the rice was huge though, easily can be shared. The hot garlic chicken was spicy and hot, containing six succulent Boneless chicken pieces, went really well with the rice. Pocket pinch is reasonable enough.

Coming to the food, the noodles didn't seem to be fresh a d the lamb was very poorly cooked and served in a chilly gravy which had big pieces of vegetables and no taste.

The price is nominal and the quantity served is also proportionate.

However their service is very nice. But for a restaurant I would recommend them to upgrade their quality of the food. As the restaurant is in a very good location but without good food it will not be worth it.",negative

4321,"Crystal Chimney is located in Chandni Chowk opposite to E-Mall . It is a very small outlet with 22 seats only. We didn't like Ambience , you can feel little unhygienic there . Let's talk about food now .
We ordered -
• Crispy Chilly Baby corn
• Chicken Lollipop

Crispy Chilly Baby corn - It was very crunchy and tasty . But excessive sweetness of the sauces killed the main taste ... So overall taste is not that great . You can ask for less sweetened version .

Chicken Lollipop - same gravy was used ( as used in baby corn ) . So the problem was same .

Positive part was quality and price ..

I am sure guys you have never tried this Indianised version of fried rice. I recommend you guys to try their fried rice because it is tastier than their biryani. Biryani is alright but not that grand. Well last time when I had their biryani they provided us 2 chicken leg pieces.💛.

The dessert GAJAR KA HALWA had a large portion can be easily shared among 2-3 people. The food was satisfying so was the pricing. Staff need to be quick and more attentive.",positive

For this particular outlet, the food standard and prices are as usual but there is one problem here which is the seating capacity and table arrangements. It is a small place but at the same time too congested if the restaurant is full.

Chicken do piyaza was very tasty but I wish they would either give bigger pieces or at least 4 pieces as 3 pieces is too less I feel. Will surely order more!",positive

We had smoked chicken salad, spaghetti, penne arabiatta, yakitori chicken, spinach dimsums, prawn cocktail. The prawn cocktail and the spinach dimsums were definitely something new to us and both tasted excellent. Rest was pretty good too.

Once you take the jetty from eco park, you have two options here, one is a Bengali cuisine restaurant and the other is the Chinese cuisine houseboat one. We went for the latter. Ordered chicken hot pepper soup, pan fried chicken Chowmein and another chicken semi gravy dish. The food and the quantity is sufficient for two people. Taste wise was nice and the best part is obviously the ambience. Eco park closes early but the restaurant serves till 10pm, after which they provide you with a small motor boat to ferry you back to eco park for the exit. I loved the food, ambience and service. You can also rent out cottages in eco park if you want to enjoy the tranquility for a longer time.",positive

After many years while passing by, on a rainy afternoon the fond memories just dragged me inside the establishment. The ambiance is still the same at its basic, no frills or cutlery. But what matters over here is the food. Was curious to know if the taste is still the same or deteriorated with time. As an old habit ordered my all time favourite combo of Special Fried Rice and Roast Pork.
Ummm, the same taste of the flavor-some meaty fried rice and smoky soya sauce chili double fried succulent pork they are still consistent with its flavor. For Tung Nam fans must try out pork here.
They don't accept plastic money or e-wallet. Prices in the menu are including tax. Each portion was enough for two of us to share. Pocket pinch was only INR 520 inclusive taxes.

They provide lavish buffet which consists of wide range of food in it.
The buffet consist of both veg and non veg items . Starting from sapad , papri chaat to daal makhni , palank paneer to chicken biriyani , mutton and many more.
After having this great strarters and maincourse , everyone will crave for dessert . So not an issue they also provide wide range of desserts starting from malpoa to varieties of pastries.
Really a lipsmacking dishes i had.
A good hygiene place with great food .
The hospitality management is really great .
Keep it up
I will do visit again .

9266,This QSR type food outlet is situated just near of my house. But I used to order through swiggy. On 1st day I ordered chicken 65 and chicken momo. And I asked extra spicy sauce to call the delivery boy and they provide it. It was at midnight 1.30. I just loved the taste of those items. Next I ordered 2 portion chicken Momo. I need to mention the Momo was excellent in taste. U will heardly found good quality of momos from this kind of QSR outlet. The chicken 65 was only spicy it was not authentic but still I like the taste. On the 2nd day I told delivery boy to bring spicy sauce but the outlet given Hotgarlic dip which was Actully more sweet. I want to tell the outlet u are doing very good job. Only start giving good quality of dips. Which is very important in oriental cuisin.....,positive

I ordered a combo which had a chicken sandwich, french fries and 3-4 chicken nuggets. It was quite filling and the price was very cheap compared to the quantity. The only turn off was that the food was cold. The fries could have been a bit more crispy.

4974,"Headed straight after a tiring shopping and discovered these lovely babies in an authentic South Indian place Banana leaf. As the name suggests it sticks to only and only South Indian delicacies serving freshly cooked dosa to other South Indian meals as well.
We ordered Rava Dosa, Filter Coffee and Coca cola. The dosa was well tossed with butter stuffed with tangy potato curry. The sambar was so up to the mark that made me overwhelmed. I'm not a South Indian food lover but this place made me fall in love with it.Talking about filter coffee it disappointed me. It was way too bitter than usual. Curtain calling it, a typical South Indian will cherish visiting the place and of course it deserve special mention as a saviour for the shopping freaks to rest and have a quick bite.

I would totally recommend you t try the Schezwan paneer,
Chonquing style chicken 
california burger, Spaghetti bolognese

If you want to try their Asian menu do try the Friend rice and kung pao chicken.

I also don't have any pictures of food though i have visited this restaurant since school days.

It's full AC , they have seating arrangements... with dim lights.

Taste of food is good, but at times there cook changes so as the taste even fluctuates . But nevertheless they don't serve bad taste foods.

I love chowmein of this restaurant. It's good.
Even chicken gravy items are good.
Once i had BBQ chicken that was so delicious, unexpected of such taste from this restaurant.

We ordered one of their Chinese combos, Egg haka noodles with Chilly chicken and are surprised to discover hair inside it.. We couldn't cancel the order as we were already done with half of the noodles. 
The chilly chicken was absolutely bland and tasteless..
We also ordered one lachchha paratha, one plain nun, and chana masala.. The nun was half-cooked. The paratha was good to taste but very hard... Chana masala is full of oil but average in taste... 
The only thing I found good in the restaurant is that they have a fat menu card and provide food in large amount maybe appropriate for three people.",negative

Must say the whole thing would been yummy if they actually mix up the whole stuff and not put dollops of cream over the fries. Or provide a small plate where we can do the same.

The decor is soothing and minimalist and the staff was courteous and took our feedback on the food. I don't see any reason why this place has such low rating. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey for some items. There is no way a glass of thums up should cost ₹45+GST. Maybe the management should look into this if they want better footfall.,positive

The Butter Masala tasted just about fine but they clealy did dilute the gravy with water. It was obvious from the consistency of the gravy. The Nun was well prepared. I would not recommend to try their Chinese. The Chowmenin tasted very average and the chicken pieces in the chowmein were not adequate. They Chilli Chicken again was just about okay in terms of taste. This is the first time I ordered from Zomato. Perviously whenever I ordered from Swiggy had better experiences.",negative
7849,"This place is part of the food court section in Acropolis mall. The food was made maintaining all hygiene measures and plated beautifully. But as for the taste, it lacked flavour.

Overall the dish wasn't quite satisfactory and would recommend trying out better places.",negative

The music is pathetic towards the beginning, while gaining some momentum as the night approches. That day the waiters seemed disinterested to take orders and we had to wait a lot to get our food. The food is equally bad. The mocktail 'Sunny Fizz' is just orange juice. The 'Quesadilla' was made of roti and had rajma in it. The Pizza was neither good. Overall a pretty forgettable experience.

Stuffed fried idly was indeed very good. Perhaps one of the best I've have had over the years.

From customer service to food quality every thing is just pathetic (to know more read my other reviews & follow me socially) whereas this poor little shabby joint in palbazar raising the bar day by day!!
Food quantity is more than two adults
Food quality is very good for certain dishes(very much AVG for others)
Food after effects are not that bad(atleast less acidic comparing to those everyday Chinese "" Giants"" of Kolkata)
Staff are actually well behaved (atleast it's how it should be)
Best servings are : mixed fried rice, mixed gravy noodles, sliced chicken with vegetables, chicken pakora & Chinese roll(One can only find it in festive seasons, so please go & 'ASK' for it)
Overall it deserves atleast one visit from every food lover out there hungry.....",positive

They claim they serve the best sizzler but it was bad. They served fish topped with some white sauce which was sweet again. May be I don’t have the taste to enjoy food of this place.

574,"Good food but with certain shortcomings. The Daab Chingri was tasty but it seemed the dish consisted of frozen prawn being added to a prepared gravy and putting it inside an used coconut shell. That is NOT how Daab chingri is cooked. It is cooked by putting the prawn and paste inside the coconut and heating the coconut itself in an oven. From a restaurant like Oh Calcutta, (having tasted one) I expected an original Daab Chingri.
The Kasundi Kakra dish tasted good - but though the menu mentions deshelled crabmeat - in actual it comprises of less of crab meat and more of flour batter. I did not found it to be at par with the price.Murgh Malai Tikka was tasty.The Daab Sondesh, Payesh though stole the show. They were yummy.All in all the place it left me with the impression that it may delight the first time bengali cuisine seeker, but for a regular/seasoned bengali food lover, it may leave marks of un-fulfillment.",negative

They serve food maintaining separate categories like food items having no carbs, foods with high protein content, less calories & so on and so forth! I have been here quite a few times and food is really good and hygienic here. I had ordered for herb tossed mushroom, stir fried chicken with Ashian greens, veg lasagna. All were healthy and tasty. Good for people who are health conscious!",positive

Over time the quality of Moghlai deteriorated a bit but emotions remained the same. Fish fry and chicken cutlets are good too.

Yes!  I’ve been meaning to come here since long. I’ve avoided writing a review of this place for years because I loved this place so much, I didn’t want a bunch of people clogging it up!.

7457,"A nice place for having vegetarian food. I visited this place a week ago. It is located just near Balwant Singh Dhaba. The interiors are pretty decent and also they have a private dining area too. The service is also good.

Here I tried out some of the dishes. Some were genuinely good but also some needs real improvement.

My recommendations are:

Mocktails :
Fire and Ice - Refreshing with a spicy kick.
Paan Shot - Very unique to it's taste, the paan masala truly enhanced the taste.

Appetizers :
Tandoori Aloo
Crispy Chilli Babycorn

Main Course :
Paneer Shabnam
Kaali Daal
Garlic Naan

Also you can try out the,
Jalepeno n olive naan
Masala kulcha
Veg Biryani. About the Veg Biryani, It's not like a typical biryani though but it's nice.

Coming to the desserts, I tried out Darsaan. It was slightly disappointing. It lacked the crisp and was too thin.
Overall had a good experience.",positive

The toppings were onion, capsicum, sweet corn, red paprika, black olives and mushroom. The sauce was probably marinara and tasted delicious but it didn't seem like there was any extra cheese which was disappointing. It had a thin crunchy crust with loads of toppings. The packaging was cheap with no pizza heightner and thin cardboard box. Taste was good and price is apt quantity wise. Wish the delivery packaging was better though.",negative

Tried out their drums of heaven and found them to be just perfect. I had only one food dish but their service just won my heart. Even they have a large bar counter and the place is really big.

Bought me the same bowl back. • The friedrice was bland , no salt. • Service is late and very bad.• After eating here i wish zomato had a minus star rating too. • Now i know why they gave us a complimentary icecream. • So dont waste your money here even if its cheap.",negative

very average.

this one as it is my fav dish . Although it wasn't
as bad as the pizza but i wish they would have
made it a bit more spicier.

4703,"I don't give a place such a low rating generally. But I couldn't go higher than 2. Mind you, the experience ""at the restaurant"" was more or less fine. We had ordered 2 starters, the tandoori aloo and mushroom. Virgin mohito. Mee Goreng noodles, chilli garlic rice and Packchoy. The noodles, mushrooms, and aloo were amazing and a must try. The mohito was good too. But the rice, was too bland. Packchoy wasn't to my taste.
The staff was polite and decent, but felt clueless about the dishes. Pricing wise it was around 700/head without alcohol. The ambiance was nothing too great either.
What compelled me to rate this place so low was that the next day, all of us feel sick with a bad stomach. So there you have it. Go there only if you want to risk having a sick day.",negative

Just that we had to wait, we asked the waiter that we are just outside the restaurant as it was becoming too difficult to stand out... We then again came back maybe after 2 mins and we get to see that the waiter instead of calling us asked someone else to enter. When asked he said that you people were not present. I mean what is this... We were just outside waiting, he could have called us right... I don't remember that person's name but he is way too disgusting. However, the good thing is that the the food which we ordered were bacon with chicken, that was awesome along with corona...

I ordered Egg Chicken Roll. The Roll was served hot. It was big in size. They took very less time to serve.

It was full of Chicken pieces. The chicken pieces were mostly in kebab forms which multiplied its taste. They were layered with a thick gravy and onions which is the main attraction of the Rolls I guess.

I would suggest to consume it at the shop only right after serving because then it remains hot and fully crispy. The crispness goes away if you bring it home because it gets cold till then.

Very nice experience. Really liked their Roll. Will order their other rolls for sure. A big Thumbs up 👍.",positive
8393,"Cookies and Cream Shake!🍪 Okay. I will be honest with this. It looks great, not as much as it was portrayed on Zomato which according to them is only available during festivals. But, it lacked sugar and costs Rs. 354 inclusive of all taxes.

Sometimes well known, most times new talent. Often the artist might also be there adding colour to his/ her painting with strokes of the paint brush.

6783,"This might not be the best place for trying Bengali cuisine but not the worst either. Prices on the menu are pretty reasonable, consequently compromising on the taste and quality of the dish. The Hilsa/Ilish Bhapa was ironically fishy as far as quality is concerned. This is not the best place to go for Biryani either but it can be judged as moderate. Chicken tikka was spicy and good, just hoping not to find their name listed with the food quality control department someday. As far as packaging for delivery is concerned, it was very bad. Restaurants serving very oily and rich curry-based dishes should be well prepared with arrangements required for good grade packaging. Oil and curry was leaking out and it was very messy and dirty with curry stains.",negative

Because of small place inside of this restaurant, people prefer to parcel it. Even for parcel you have to stand in a long queue. Now talking about the biriyani- it's very rich and spicy but very tasty. They give only one piece of mutton / chicken in one packet of biriyani. If you take special biriyani then you will get 2 pieces of meat, and obviously Kolkata style biriyani can not be completed without a big spicy aromatic aloo.

The outlet is pocket-friendly, food items available here are mostly prepared by chefs from the Indismart Hotel. Have noticed few things, firstly the items get out of stock before evening almost so food available here are always very fresh. Secondly the preparations are clean & hygienic, & the best part is they taste really good.

Have tried the brownie chocolate, chicken puff, sausage hot dog from the confectionary point. Now they have added a live counter recently where we tried fried chicken with chips & mayonnaise dip, fish fry with fresh fries & dip.

We had chicken sweet corn soup, chicken thukpa, mixed fried rice and takrai chicken.

The takrai chicken contained 8 pieces of chicken tossed with onion, lemon grass and bell peppers. Will give full marks to this item.",positive

5192,A decent neighbourhood joint. I loved the chicken wontons and Thai chicken. These are the things which drew me here. But as time flies and things age the quality of food dropped and price became higher and higher. Keeping in mind the decor and level of service the restaurant seems to overshoot their prices. The food quality is poor of late and I have stoped ordering as well gradually. Good for a first try. A second try maybe not. Keep ur money safe with u,negative

Or if you are for any work around that area i would suggest you to have some healthy tasty Sandwiches, burgers and shakes from this N.V stores. 

Though a very small shop , located in a crowded area. But foods are very delicious. Just exactly opposite to Khaddo Bhavan. 

I happened to cross that street and as recommended by some friends made up my mind to taste the sandwiches. 
I found it yummy, delicious. They make it in a very proper manner. They have many types of Sandwiches, you can order as per your choice.

With the strike through of Pepperez from that region I really expected to have good dishes from their end. But it turns out to be negetive.. even the roadside vada paw uncle make better than them.

I have tried most of their pavs, but only like the cheese one. After getting fed up with their pavs, tried some burger which is expensive than expected. The burger is compact.

So I decided to order a drink (Jim Beam), glass was full if stains and had an alien particle in it.

The service is superfast and the waiters pay due attention to the customers. The chutney served alongwith masala dosa is thick and tasty and the same goes for the sambar dal. However, the potato stuffing inside the dosas is a bit soggy and due to that the dosas loose their crispness very soon. I would suggest them to use dry potato curry as stuffing to retain the unique taste of their jumbo sized dosas.That apart, the place is ok for a pocket friendly meal.",negative

Quesadillas were great and truly loved the generous filling of spinach and cheese. The tortillas were a bit crunchy and the warm cheese filling is sure to leave your tastebuds wanting for more. It was one of the best quesadillas I have had in Kolkata. [4/5]
The Pizza was truly disappointing. The crust was very dry from the first bite. Also, the cheese just fell off on being bitten. The combination of toppings chosen was good but these two factors truly put off the entire experience after having those great quesadillas. I hope they improve their pizza dough. [2/5]

It was complete package for Rs 199.
We ate Aloo Cheese Roll , Paneer Cheese Roll , Potato Twister , French Fries.
Both the rolls tasted excellent & were healthy as well but i felt the cheese given was bit less.
But again in this price point its hard to complain.

Coming to delivery , we ordered :-

1. Tandoori Litti and Achaari Litti with Desi Ghee :- Two (2) pieces of each with aloo chokha, tomato bharta and green chutney.

First of all litti was very hard and too much dry;

Secondly, the quantity of Litti dissapointed me as they are offering only two (2) pieces of Litti at much higher prices compared to other 'Litti Shops' opened in the city.

Chokha was good and so was bharta ;

2. Cheese Pav Bhaji :- It was ok, nothing extraordinary ;

3. Sattu Paratha :- With mint chutney and pickles, sattu paratha was good but instead of mint chutney it should have been complemented with curd or raita which would have been much better choice.

Overall it's better for one time only.",negative

Now some of our orders are:
✴Virgin Mojito
✴Mutton Chilli Fry
✴Grilled Fish In Basil Butter Sauce

* Tandoori Chicken

You will be amazed to know that Naushiijaan is the one and only food joint who has introduced Awadhi cuisine in the City of Joy. So if you are looking for a good place to have Biryanis and different types of Kebabs then drop down here.

On my visit I tried out :
Chicken Orhni Kebab
Mutton Jugalbandhi
Galawti Kebab

From the main course,
Handi Biryani
Naushijaan special Biryani
Mutton Band Gosht

Also don't miss out the Masala chaach and Aam Lassi here.

6246,This place is a hidden gem in behala tram depot. It os an age old coffee house. The seating arrangement is very bad and you have to seat just in front of a grocery shop. But coming to food and the prices...everything is bearable. They serve around 70 varieties of south Indian dishes and all of them are quite authentic . The cheese dosa at 60 rupees was a steal deal. They have an amazing filter coffee to polish it off too. Recommended as a pocket friendly food joint.,positive

1) chicken soup ,which was contained small pieces of chicken , it was light and delicious too.
2)In starter Tangy style dry chicken , tasted bad.
3)Olik potato, fried potato with spices, it was also not too good.
In main course _
Egg fried rice
Egg Hakka noodles

Schezuan chilli chicken, most probably it was the best of that menu.

Great variety of dishes are served here. Includes chicken and fish too.

Pizzas are really good here. They cook it so well.

I had 4 toppings thin crust Pizza, that was topped with tossed onions, mushrooms, tomato and olives. And a bit of cheese added to it. Tasted so good must say.

Even the dining area has really nice decoration and also a big projector that's telecasts different sports. So you can just come here, enjoy your food with your favorite sports and also enjoy some drinks ( carry your 21+ Id proof ).",positive

We ordered only two dishes as we weren't hungry but just wanted to try out their food. The fried rice was very tasty but the chicken item wasn't that good. The chicken was tasting stale and a bit smelly.

A clean washroom is a thing that restaurants should put some importance to. And, Aafter 9 gets a big 5 in this matter. They have clean washrooms separately for men and women.

I hope they bring some improvements and serve better food. Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

10434,"Had to do quite a bit of searching to reach this place. Primarily for takeaways and not for indulging the food there and then. But the owner was kind enough for arranging some seating arrangement for me. Ordered a beef burger. Took about ten minutes to prepare it and be served Infront of me. The first bite and I had fallen in love with the burger. My oh my it was great! The beef patty soft and succulent, the fries perfectly cooked and the dip perfectly balanced with all kinds of sauce and spices. Hands down one of the best place in Kolkata to satisfy one's crave for good ol' burgers.
The only downside is the location. Tucked in the interior of Kasba one dosen't easily come across the place. Had a talk with the owner and he had told me that they would shift somewhere more easily accessible. So hopefully that does happen quickly for I haven't been able to take out time and go there the second time for its location.

Now coming to the java grilled fish, it was rich on spices. It tastes best with Kai pad pak. Teriyaki egg fried rice is ordinary. It is bland so it goes well with Java grilled fish as well. Japanese teriyaki chicken is also simple yet elegant. You can combine it with Hakka chicken noodles. You won’t be disappointed!

Coming to food, for starters, we were served fish kobiraji and battered fiah. With fresh water verkiezingen, you can't really go wrong and it were good here also. Gor main course, crab kosha was simply superb. The next recommendation would be pabda bori jhol with plain rice. The hilsa with mustard was fiery enough and fish was really fresh. Dab chingri could've been slightly better and id really prefer mid sized prawn (rather than large ones served here) to soak in more of the flavor. Surprisingly, the vegetarian selection was fantastic. Dhoka r dalna and chharar dalna really stood out.

Overall, recommended.

What I liked most was the totally new concept of Patishapta with Chicken and fish . I mean who could think of Patishapta in this form . So experienced a completely unique preparation and thoroughly enjoyed it.

What I didn't like was that both the Patishaptas were too oily , you can see it from the pictures I have attached. I would request both the Chefs and Management to pay attention to this matter. Otherwise good.",positive

I have been a regular foodie here. Mixed chowmine , mixed rice here is brilliant. The biriyani here is ordinary , but fried items like roll, fish fry, fish finger, chicken pakora are mouthwatering. If one is fond of continental cusine one must try American Choupsey. Dry chilli fish has been my personal favourite. The fish is fresh and it is a perfect blend of flavours. The food is not only cheap and tasty it's also stomach filling.",positive

Chicken Biryani- We couldn't resist out Biryani Cravings, it was flavoursome, made in Hyderabadi Style with Chicken Chunks inside. Very tasty.

The keema fries come with french fries combined with superb tasty chicken keemas topped with molten cheese and if you are a cheese lover, you can ask for extra cheese gratings.. these types of joints are fun to sit and chat with friends.

We tried their most famous FISH KOBIRAJI out here and boy o boy it was totally out of world. The size of it was gigantic enough for a single person to have it and get filled up for nothing more to eat. The fish inside was fresh and soft and and the layer or filling and egg inside was thick enough to make it taste heavenly.
Not to forget they have their special in house Mustard sauce which was superb tasty with the fish kobiraji.
They also serve an array of Chinese dishes which seemed tasty though we didnt tried it on.

This place near deshapriya park has been rightfully named as it serves every dosa with innovation and twist as promised. The variety of dosa available here is surely a reason to make the choice of menu go real hard. Not only dosa, but this place also serves different version of other famous south indian dishes like idli, utttapam etc.

Coming to the food, we had ordered -

1. Mutton cheese dosa - one of the best version of dosa tasted so far with that finely minced mutton and the excellent sambar
Price - 150

2. Mushroom masala dosa - yet another master piece as the taste would compel you to grab another plate of it.
Price - 175

I really loved the Wrap,Pizza, and Burger as it was perfectly made. Kitkat shake was also good.

Cheese Burst Footlong & Garlic bread tasted more or less the same. Now coming to Garlic Bread it lacked a bit of Garlic flavour and it could be improved.
Pasta was average and it needed to be a bit more cheesier.

The drinks are sorta cheap but the food is a little on the costlier side. We had ordered for 2 tuborg and 1 Blender's pride.

It was covered with gravy which consisted of bell peppers, baby corn and broccoli. The noodles were clumped together and not even 'pan fried' as the dish should be. It just seemed like cold noodles boiled and gravy poured over it. The bill came up to 1000 INR. The service was okay but the food was not worth the money.

Mocktails too deserve special mention. Must try ""Sex in Africa"" and ""Date with me"". The kebabs that we had were so succulent and well cooked. Ghunzao chicken is best of the lot. Ilish biriyani and dhakai pomfret, perfect lunch combo you can take. Mughlai sartaj sabji is another must try dish you can have there. It's a three layered dry curry and you can team it up well with kabuli nan. Fried ice cream for dessert is not a bad choice.

P.S. – 

1) There are no Cover Charges on Weekdays but still it is recommended to get this confirmed over the phone before going.

2) No Service Charges as such and GST is 5%.",positive

5464,"The surrounding and ambience is perfect for family and office friends and team parties.
As far as the food is concerned the taste was pretty Indian Chinese and we loved it.
The Garlic Spicy chicken was very tasty. The Golden Fried Prawns were very crunchy. The American crispy corn and french fries were a bit let down. We did not have much variety to choose from for Veg Main course, so we ordered Oriental Vegetables in white sauce, and it turned out to be really bad. The singapore  chicken was spicy and tasty. The chilly garlic noodles and fried rice both were good enough. 
The fresh lime soda was excellent here.
All over a nice experience, will visit again!",positive

Rolls, noodles, rice, Biriyani, chanp, chilli paneer, chilli chicken, paratha, rumali roti, paneer butter masala, mutter paneer, egg cury, tadka almost you get most of the commonly eaten dishes here. Taste wise food is not that hi-fi but not that bad too. They serve food which is best suited with the price the take. I am happy with the food as they charge it reasonably but quality can be a little better.",negative

I looked online browsing through rolls and cakes and everything else but it was evening and I thought why not a paratha!! Came here after some considerate selection I went for Paneer Paratha and when it arrived it looked mouth watering with aroma of ghee all around my cubicle(since I was at work). And when I had the first bite it melted in my mouth. A paratha as soft as a pastry.. wow!!
I had the whole of it in a few bites and I was full up to the brim. The taste was unique and something which lingers in your mouth for long after you had it..
Will have it again again and again.
Loved it!!!",positive
4297,"Mumbai Local as the name says it specialises in the street food of Mumbai, also serves North Indian and Chinese Cuisine. It is a theme based place on the local trains of Mumabai. The  mouth watering food out here will make you forget your cravings for non veg food incase you feel it is a waste to be in a pure Veg restaurant. You may completely binge on items like Chanachur paratha, Takatak Chilli Potato, Dhasu Dabeli, Chinese Samosas, Vada Pav , Kabab Platter and more.
The food presentation will leave you spell bound for sure. Many people go for indulging in these food items for dinner rather than going for the regular main course served here like Malai KolftaAloo do Pyaza, Mongolian Noodles. Rest you can be sorted with Chowpaty Gola barood, Strawberry shake, Margaritas of different falvour too.

When it comes to food it is even better!  Murg jhaal lonka tikka and nolen gurer payesh should be a must in your order list.

Naan, mix veg and salad. Food was horrible to say least. I was really hoping for good taste because there were so fine review on zomato about the restaurant.
Naan was huge it was well made and chewable. Mix vegetable doesn't looked like mix veg. It was just lot of thick gravy with these thin shredded vegetable. I don't know if that's what they called mix veg because I certainly don't..
My experience is horrible and I'm not sure if I will order from this place again.",negative

We ordered mocha frape, chicken tonduri pizza, chocolate brownie with vanila ice cream.

Mocha frape was ok. Frappé is sold primarily in Greece and is among the most popular drinks in Greece and Cyprus though Frappe is a french word.

The pizza was excellent. From crust to toppings, everything was perfect. It is a great combination of Italian and indian cuisine. We were very satisfied with the quantity and quality. A must try item.

But, the brownie was the real starrer. It was as delicious as it looks. It was soft, creamy. The flavours of choclate and vanilla will last in your mouth forever.

Being one of the oldest place it's still in good shape, alas the current generation doesn't understand that the dim lights is a way to show that the place provides quietness and personal space to the guests.
The food was great and delicious, the staff professional and par time.
Ordered sweet and sour pork along with chicken fooyung or chicken omlette and the food didn't dissappointed me.
Though the ketchep used in pork is more then needed making it a bit sweeter then necessary which is the only difference I found in the traditional pork and it. The fooyung was made early and served with the pork making it a bit cold but that didn't diminish the taste.",positive

I have tried their mushroom burger too for experiment and it wasn’t less in taste than the chicken burger , totally worth having it.

We had English breakfast and few sandwiches. We enjoyed it. I bought cake from there to bring home. I think they can do little better with the cake quality and the maintenance. Would definitely go again.,positive

Food-
✓ Grilled chicken with spaghetti aglio crispy garlic butter bread and topped with mozzarella .
(4/5) It was served hot . The chicken was tender and has that authentic Italian touch to it. It wasn't spicy and really delicate to your taste buds.Enough to serve a single person.
✓ Red Velvet cheese Cake (5/5) - It was ambrosial. The cake was moist and the cheesecake had a little heart shape. The sweet cake complimented great with the cream cheese. It was just like a match made in heavy. Too heavy for a single person to have it alone .
The service was quick. The staff member has been really helpful in choosing the dish . Really a great experience being here.
Being a bakery the sweet dish of this place lived upto my expectations and I would love to revisit this place again and again. I would love to recommend this place to everyone.",positive

Really lip smacking food prepared by Chef Ahmed Hussain and special thanks to the F&B manager Mr Suresh for his suggestions. The portions are generous and the pricing is quite reasonable.
The food was prepared fresh so the service took long. The food was surely worth the wait. Looking forward to more visits in the future.",positive

It is one of the fast food shop of my locality. Initially when it was opened 2-3 years back everything was so good and well maintained. The staff.s, cook and food quality used to be very good and tatsy initially. I use to frequently have momo, chicken chowmein, moghlai paratha from there and my favourite was chicken lollipop. They use to make awesome chicken lollipop. But later on with time passing by, with lack of proper maintenance and management, everything has been degraded. The shops looks so shaby and unclean now a days. The old staffs and good cooks are not there anymore.  All the items mentioned in the menu card is also not available anymore everytime. I also dont find my favourite chicken lollipop available many a times.",negative

But, still expected a lot from this place. They also limit their Menu on Pujo days.

We Ordered, Mixed Fried Rice, Manchurian Chicken And Chilli Pork. The rice was unboiled and some vegetables were unboiled too. Both the chicken and pork gravy looked same, and it was really difficult to identify both the dishes. The gravy was filled with soya sauce and literally looked like a sea.

The owner does not know what the staff is doing. The staff does not know what the owner will shout at them for.

Called into the restaurant after in the queue for an hour at least. Half an hour later, food order still has not been taken.

Half of the staff out for break. Owner is no where to be found. The manager's presence is negligible. The ruckus inside is visible with at least 3 customers waiting for someone to take their food order.

This is the most horrible experience in my entire food outing in Kolkata",negative

The Sunday Brunch had an array of dishes to choose from and one is literally pampered with options. They had a live counter serving starters (specifically Japanese dishes). Also amongst the starters were a variety of Kababs and some lovely sushi. The main course was a delight and consisted of some exhilarating stuff, right from Biryani to Laal Maas to fish delicacies and so on. The desserts section was a dream come true..... especially for those with a sweet tooth. In the end Cafe Swiss does indeed spoil one with a plethora of dishes. The pocket pinch is light considering the variety and quality of food up for grabs....a bargain considering all the factors in play.

After tasting biryani here for the very first time the first thing that came into my mind was why is this place so underrated!!I am not sure about now but back then i felt they served the finest biryani.Yes I definitely never really preferred to dine in the eatery itself..the reason being I didn't find the sitting area to be that clean. Nevertheless..i hope the quality & taste of biryani is still the same!,negative

Steamed momos were good (normal and not anything special) and the chutney was really spicy, pan fried momos were kind of sweet, may be they used too much of tomato ketchup or something (it tasted like that), I liked the Garlic rice (best of all). I don't think it's a really good place to visit for the vegetarians, we couldn't drink water from the glass as it had some smell (probably something non-veg). Overall the service was good, they served quick, ambiance was normal and it was pocket friendly too. Not quite sure about the next visit.",negative

It serves churros , stroopwafel, waffles, shakes and savouries too!! Everything we ordered was so yummy that we ordered it again!! It’s quite modestly priced !!

Music was really loud.
We 1st ordered something else as per they suggested.. After 30mins they told us they don't have those foods right now.. So again we ordered something else which i really didn't liked..
The food is slightly expensive.

Cushions, sofa sheets were very dirty.
Overall, not happy..",negative

They serve thai and chinese dishes also, but once I had nasi goreng there, but to be honest I have had better versions later in some restaurants of Kolkata. The chicken starter dishes on the other hand, was really good and full of flavours.",negative

Just open the Zomato Online App and order from Kathi Junction. i ordered three Single Egg Single Chicken Roll as for snacks and it was delivered to me very fast.

Both the dishes were of sufficient quantity for two, the 10 pieces of chicken were awesome. The noodles was also of great taste with sufficient protein.
Ambience: Excellent staff. The decor is Chinese themed with this soft lighting and a bamboo themed wall and big chinese letters. It could easily be listed in the places for soft romance.

The noodles and rice were good, enough small slices of egg, chicken and prawn was there. Quantity was also good, can be easily shared between two people. But the chilli chicken was a disaster, it was excessively spicy along with bland gravy floating oil on it.

Overall a not so good experience.",negative

Otherwise, it was overall fine.",negative
8926,"Today (26-Sep-2018) we ordered 2 plates of mutton biryani through a online food delivery app from Copper Cook. Quality of biryani was very ordinary rather below the average. 
First the pros - Quantity was more than enough for a single person. 2 medium size mutton pieces with a boil egg were perfect show stealers. 
Now the cons - 
1.Mutton were little stiff. Not at all melting in the mouth kind of a quality. 
2. Quality of Rice could had been much better. Felt little bit dry. 
3. No aroma at all. Biriyani without its aroma is nothing but white rice n meat.
4. Potato was rock hard. Have to throw away the whole potato.
5. No salad, no raita",negative

Coming to the food, we tried the Canada cheese soup, which was warm and tasty. Perfect for winters. I liked the fact that they serve pizzas in different sizes. We tried the Oriental pizza which had oriental flavours which was good. It should be tried once just for the sake of experience. And then we had the famous grilled paneer with spinach, mushrooms and almond sauce. The sauce was excellent. But the grilled paneer was so disappointing. It wasn't grilled properly, it tasted bland and it just wasn't good.
There can be a lot of improvements.",negative

My order was as so. Things I liked, was the mutton biryani at the same time it left was it was reheated and served to us. The quality of mutton was good at The same time the spices flavour just overpowered the food. If this is made this way, I guess I am not built for it.

This outlet used to have some small fluffybrotis and that is missing in the menu. The regular nan was good but lacked the old charm.

Now the ambience of the place. Plain and simple good.

Staff of the place seemed too busy in themselves taking and doing things. Missing the elements if what is termed as F&B service.",negative

The biggest upset was the bill , where they charged GST, CGST, and SGST seperately. When again asked about this ,they said it's on customers will if they want to give it or not. Advise, don't try to fool people who give you business.",negative

Now located at a place which doesn't lack options for good food you only visit this place if you don't have a choice, which was our case during Pujas this year. The Ambiance of loud music and smoke in the air gives you a feel that alcohol will definitely be served, only that is not the case and the place is strictly non alcoholic. We ordered Chicken Kurkure alongwith a couple of mojito coolers for starters. The finger food was good but the mojitos not so much. For the main Course we ordered Pasta al pesto and Chinese sizzler, we had to order these because a lot of the items on the menu were not available. And as expected both these were disastrous. So if you go by my advice then you can go in and order some finger food and mocktails, however if you can give this place a miss. Kolkata doesn't lack quality food outlets.",negative

Had ordered Americano and Hazelnut Coffee. No complaints regarding the coffee. Coming to the food. Had ordered Mutton Chapli Burger which also had a chef special logo next to it. For all those who don't know what a Chapli kebab is....its a famous Peshawari kebab which is made of Meat and bone marrow. It is mixed with onion, garlic, ginger and chilly and fried in animal fat. No comparisons with that but when an item is earmarked as a chef special item it is supposed to blow you away. Such was not the case with our burger. The buns were not toasted and the bread used was stale. The patty was dry and pretty bland. The egg poach was completely dry and not runny as is expected in a burger and the Mayo was not applied consistently.",negative

3720,"Thanks to my friend for suggesting this place. Honestly i was apprehensive initially. My friend insisted on trying out this place. Though I am not too sure about the food. But I can assure you that if not the cheapest it is one of the cheapest places in south Kolkata for alcohol. If you are short on some bucks then go and try out this place. Now the two important things that you should know(if you are a first timer)---1. You have to make a membership card for ₹150 which will be valid for one year (without which alcohol will not be served to you) 2. You have to be an adult.
Doesn't matter if you are alone or in a group you will need just one membership card.
Service is decent.

The place is located at hotel celesta, baguihati bigbazar.
Ambience is really nice, decent you can say.
They serve buffet which cost rs 849, which includes starter like mochar chop to biriyani to illish and to dessert and lot more.

According to the price they are serving a lot more items and it is satisfactory for every one.

Steamed Dimsum: The dimsums were too much flour and too little stuffing. Although I really loved the dips and the ginger garlic soup served along with them.

They shouldn't advertise something which they can't provide, for example they wrote free WiFi but there wasn't any, they wrote they accept all types of cards but they take only cash.

A great location with a comfy & classic Cafe cum diner kind of ambience. Most importantly, delicious food lands in ur tummy while being not so heavy on your pocket..
Loved the chef's special chicken - tender & juicy chicken pieces with the right dressing & sides. Pasta here is also nice. Lamb bolognese was a miss for me though (too much sweetness in the sauce).

The experience here definitely warrants multiple visits.. So if you haven't tried this place, don't miss out and step up here..",positive

I'll say each food dish I ordered were delicious especially malai kofta. My grand parents really liked their food and ambience. Good ambience, good food and value for money what else do we need.",positive
7907,"The restaurant is pretty bad when you look at it from outside, and you are even more disappointed when you step in as the restaurant is completely vegetarian. The owners don't bother to keep much staff here as the restaurant is mostly empty and the costs have risen in the past few months which has even stopped the college crowd and the students in the nearby PG's to come and have a meal. They prefer Fatso which offers more variety or even Blossom which has somewhat the same price but offer varieties.
However, if you are a vegetarian who wants to stay away from non-veg as much as possible, this is the place for you. The Butter Naan with the Palak Paneer was delicious, and I didn't order much, so I don't have much to say about other items. However, I will pay a visit again in some time to try a few other dishes as you never know what suits your mouth.

Initially it was disappointing but later after having food I felt good.. 

They have decent taste of food.. nicely cooked and served decoratively.. 
We ordered Harissa veg croquettes, herb spiced paneer fritters, Pasta and pizza.. Paneer fritters were ok ok as the paneer was not soft.. but rest of the items were good..

The entrance is narrow, even the seating allotment in the upstairs needs to be more spacious. The table was not equibalanced too on the four stands. Since the initial experience was not so good, I was waiting for the dish to be tasty. The experience there is too moderate. The #kabab was good with the sausage, the salad was not upto the mark, even the carrot pieces were old. The number of elaichi found in the plate of #muttonbiriyani completely demoralized the hunger mood. Might it be a speciality of the restaurant, but it didn't work at all. The only dish I would praise is the chicken dopeyaja, the real taste of it still ticked with the taste buds. #sovanspeaks",negative

Along with that we ordered Chicken Afghani and Beijing chicken..Both were tasty.

The appam are pancakes and they were soft and too good. We tried the plain and egg ones...I preferred the plain one more as it is lighter. For starters we tried the Kori Neirost and it was nice...a lot like kebabs just with curry leaves! They served us with complimentary buttermilk and paan at the end. The paan was yummy!.,positive

1433,"A tiny gem hidden in the busy streets of kolkata. Just in the lane opposite Forum Mall, this place gives u a peaceful moment to relax.
.
An updated and upgraded of a cafe. It serves you with good food along with ample choices of pastries and bakery items.
.
Cold Coffee here along with the Chicken Sandwiches are too good.
.
The service here is good, the staffs don't disturb you much and give you your little privacy which is very much missing from most of the coffee outlets in Kolkata.

If you want a place to chill with an intention to pacify with urself, this is the place.",positive

8735,"Cafe Je Taime is a beautiful place and has a nice ambience. Their service is good and the staffs are pretty cordial. They also have lots of games to play and even books and magazines are available on each table. Coming to the food, we had ordered:
1) Baked au gratin
2) Chicken Caesar salad

I loved the Baked augratin. It was so cheesy and was filled filled assorted veggies and lots of pieces of chicken. It was enough for two persons.

The Caeser salad was also very good. It had olives, croutons, mayonnaise, chicken and vegetables. The quantity was really good.

I'd recommend all to visit this Cafe and try their items. ❤️",positive

5011,"Had ordered a combo pack for 1. It had a pouch of French fries, a burger, 300ml coke and two pieces of fried chicken! Well you might be excited to hear about it and so was I! But....

Well, once I got it delivered to my place, it was not like any other similar combo that you might have had. The chicken in the burger was a complete waste and was not soft at all. It was not soft or juicy, but was completely course and tasteless. Well, I thought might be the French fries would have something better in store. But alas... they were tasteless too, as they did not give salt to it. Finally the fried chicken was a complete bone piece having hardly any chicken over it. Hated the complete experience.

One of the best pure veg restaurants you can get in these parts .
We reached the place just when the last order was being taken..anyway we cud squeeze in our order before the kitchen closes.
Couldn't try the soup and jumped directly to the main course. Paneer butter masala , Mix vegetables curry , butter naan , garlic naan and chappati were laid fresh on the table.
The PBM was out of this world...very rich and creamy. It was going very well with the garlic naan...each one complimenting themselves for the flavour. The mix veg was a mixed bag..!😎

It was a great experience",positive
3181,"Ordered mutton kadai online. Received four rather small bony pieces of mutton. The accompanying gravy was spicey but didn't mix well with the mutton pieces. The capsicum pieces were raw and the tomatoes were not thoroughly mashed.This kind of oily and spicey food is usually sold at street corner food joints.Of course ,the price was on the lower side and that was the saving grace. Still, far better food can be served at this price.",negative

There’s an amazing aquarium is an attraction of course. There’s only a drawback which is, the food was warm, so it dulled the experience a bit. The staff is courteous and well behaved.

In frame: Chicken Mushroom Soup

Mixed Fried Rice

7288,"Biryani...one preparation that just doesn't cater to everyone's taste buds the same way. I had the chicken biryani from this place a couple of days back and it fared well enough. There were some shortcomings but overall it was decent, with no abundance in richness. The chicken was cooked thoroughly but the potato piece could have been better. There's nothing to go gaga about it but nothing to rile up to defend the honor of our beloved biryani either. There are not-so-posh joints that actually serve biryani which every Calcuttan swears by. It certainly isn't that but who can deny the importance of the day-to-day eateries that sustain us?",positive

The Texan burger is a pointlessly big burger with soggy beef patty topped with barbeque sauce glazed onion rings that taste like charcoal. Even their french fries were pathetic, so salty and burnt that I wondered if it is meant to discourage you from ever having fries in your life. They have fallen from grace.

We almost had 7-8 starters and all were worth the value. We had bruschetta which was very good, turkish borek (which is one of their popular dish) , forest pizza, green pasta, hariyali tikka masala, tetrazzini and hot and sweet ceispy noodles. All the starters were very good in taste. Among the desserts sizzling brownie with ice cream was my favourite. Even their main course was quite satisfying.

For hygiene, will give this restaurant 1* as we found small mouse running on the floor while waiting for the order and washing basin was clogged with water being overflowing.

Coming to food, We had Mutton Biriyani(3.5/5), Chicken Kadai(2/5), Naan(2.5/5).
Biriyani had a large chunk of mutton with mostly meat and a small piece of bone. Mutton was melt-in-mouth soft but the potato was a bit hard in the middle.
Chicken Kadai had a intense hint of capsicum flavour and large piece of onions.

Overall, although they have a reasonable price tag on the menu but taste wise they were not that good.",negative

Now coming to our experience, it was one of the worst. We got our table and waited 15mins just to get it cleaned. Once that was taken care, our next mission was to get hold of a waiter to get the menu and place the order. It took another 15mins tondo that. Then came the next challenge, having the food and the drinks served which took another 20mins. Looking at their service we only ordered a tandoori chicken even that took ages to come and that too partially cold. Even it took another 15mins to get the bill settled.

Food is very basic stuff, service is out of this world as they are very much understaffed. So on the month end when u r frustrated with ur job and are low on cash, this is the place u want to be in. 😉",negative

They don't even know the courtesy how to attend customers and they don't even have any softdrinks . They are just fooling people this restaurant should be closed immediately.,negative

Went last night for dinner and had a brilliant meal! For appetizers we had a Fish Cake marinated in That red curry, along with Steamed Dumplings followed by a Clear Soup with Glass Noodles. For mains we went for my all time favourite Phad Thai with peanuts, a Pork Stir Fry and Thai Yellow Curry with rice. We also got a complementary cake as it was my mother's birthday.

There was chicken sweet corn soup, crab cakes,mixed grill, bbq pork chops, mixed meifoon,mixed fried rice,teriyaki chicken and shepherd's pie. Pork chops were the best of the lot. All the dishes were tasty and sufficient quantity wise for 6 of us to share. Unfortunately couldn't take pics since we were too hungry and it was getting late. Will definitely visit the plave someday and try other dishes too. Pocket friendly restaurant, bill came to Rs 2400 only.

Hariyali kebabs were soft, Succulent, juicy and quite big but lacked that taste.

Chutney/Dhaniya raita along with it is a disappointment though. It lacks the subtlety of how it should've been and that's one basic mistake one should not make. You won't find yourself asking for the chutney as you would at other prime Muglai restaurants in city.

Hong Kong Noodles too needs special mention, as this also own my heart. Loved the taste. But I would've been preferred more, if it would have been less oily. The quantity was enough for two.

To start with, this place is still among the cheapest bars in Kolkata. Service is prompt. The place is huge & sometimes you need to raise your voice a bit to get the attention of the waiters.

No loud music so you can have a good round of discussion with friends, partners, etc. I enjoy the place alone sitting by one of the windows & gazing at the slow moving traffic outside in the heart of Calcutta's business district.

They have a very fixed menu lacking most of the Bengali delicacies and successfully ruined my Saturday afternoon lunch.
The lentil curry (dal) was cool as ice, even though we had our food at 1 pm.
The mutton curry was the worst I had in my life. It cost us 170 bucks but what they served was three cold tiny pieces of bone.
The bhetki paturi being a bit warm was still better than the rest.
Altogether it was a complete disaster and I would recommend to try Bengali food at some other food joints. Don't waste your money on cold food!

Flat white coffee was perfect if you dislike foam in your coffee. Hazelnut Cappuccino was good with a nutty flavor. I was really amazed with the Dark Chocolate Zucchini Bread (gluten free). It tasted like a normal chocolate cake (really want the recipe now!)

I ordered pork yaam wonton,mixed fried rice and pork chilli.
The pork yaam wonton was very simple to look at but it was bursting with flavours once tasted.
Mixed fried rice and pork chilli tasted too good especially the mixed fried rice.
They serve food items in a huge proportion at a cheap price tag plus the quality of food you get is impressive at the same time so this joint is a hidden gem.
Overall I would highly recommend this place to everyone for the authentic chinese dishes available here.",positive
4583,"Starting with the pros of this restaurant since that are not much in this case. First, the location and the ambience is very good with spacious interiors. But that ends the list since the rest of the stuff is pretty much not as what I had expected. Talking about the food..it was average. We ordered vanilla shake which was very blant. The worst part of all was the service which goes haywire once they gete flooded with orders and then they are not able to manage everything. Better service would have helped me changed my thoughts about this place.",negative

They don't know how to cook Chinese at all...... don't know how come they have a rating of 3.7. The ambience is also nothing special. The fried rice was overcooked and the chilli fish had excessive salt. The shezwan pork was disgusting in taste and i dout whether it was pork at all.,negative
114,"Being a Bengali myself I would say they serve Bengali food with authenticity. Though I'm not a big fan of having Bengali food outside my home but still it's a good place at the end. Lovely festive buffets would help u sample Bengali food in all its glory. Really liked the kosha mangsho, nice mocktail and some appetizers.for first timers try their ilish Mach bhaja or other preparation as might me suggested to you. Really like the way a family home being conveyed into a restaurant. The balance of heritage and contemporary skills have been well kept in mind here.",positive

1832,If you crave for hilsa and you're too lazy then this is the place to be.. During their hilsa festival.. Delicious boneless hilsa along with some steamed rice is pure Mirth for a short span of time .. In terms of decor and ambience the place is quite decent.. Service is also quite good.. Also loved their rendition of the prawn cocktail.. Their hilsa is credible enough for at least a single visit if not more..,positive
8305,"Don’t be fooled by the exterior, this place may look like a small eatery in an old bengali makan but it packs big flavours. 
Also known as Bhupendra Mansion after the building it is housed in, i have been visiting this place for over 2 decades now and it still has the same taste. Its a favourite among morning walkers for breakfast but you can go here at lunch or dinner time and it would still be the same. 
It is not a very large space and is mostly quite busy but worth the wait if you have to stand in queue. 
You may think that the menu is not very elaborate but most things on the menu are worth trying. I personally love their sambhar. We’ve tried most stuff on the menu but our repeat orders are
~Paper Masala Dosa
~Sambhar Vada
~Idly with special chutney
~Filter coffee. 
One disclaimer; their regular filter coffee is very sweet so we order without sugar and add it later. 
The staff is courteous and prompt. 
Overall a must try !",positive

after having one spoon we just thought-what a shit !!!
the quality of rice was so poor.there was no trace of জায়ফল জয়িত্রী ঘি in it.the mutton pieces were too chippy.absolutely flavourless.no aroma no potato and no egg.but what is the price??including gst it was around 260 rs.!!

6689,"One of the best food experiences I have ever had! If you are in Kolkata and in search of an authentic Bengali culinary experience, look no further! When I say authentic I mean the very notion of it, starting from the set up to ambience to live Bengali music and not to forget the main part, food itself! Bhoomi at the Vedic Village Spa and Resort will leave you wanting you for more and more. The veg thali costs 1299/- + taxes and the Non veg one costs 1499/- + taxes, but when compared to the experience that you get, it’s totally worth every money. The starters, the main course and dessert everything was really well balanced with flavour and taste and I couldn’t ask for more. Visit this one asap if you haven’t and thank me later.",positive

We ordered Mutton kabiraji  chicken kabiraji and mutton breast cutlet. The kabiraji was huge and very oily( and it was supposed to be like that). Since the place had no air conditioning it was a bit difficult to enjoy the meal. The breast cutlet was also quite tasty. The pricing of the items were pretty decent. And their service was very satisfactory. The staff was very attentive. He even gave us extra salad and mustard. Overall it was a pleasing experience for us.,positive

Next day I again ordered Sweet corn soup with chicken fried rice, chilly chicken and dragon chicken.
This time I was a bit disappointed. The fried rice was out of the world but the chicken dishes were blunder. The chilly chicken was different with a whitish gravy which I liked but the chicken pieces were fibrous hard and not fried. The Dragon chicken which I expected to be a starter came with gravy. Though I liked the gravy but again the chicken pieces gave tough fight to my denture. But  I will visit soon and try some of their other dishes.",positive

Normally when a restaurant is giving a discount or an item is on offer we can't expect the quality to be the same as it on full cost. However I was taken aback when my notion was busted with their quality. I ordered a chicken roll via food panda at just ₹ 19 and it was fantastic. Today I ordered a full on meal consisting of lachha paratha , egg kasha and biriyani. The parathas were soft and not at a all chewy. The egg kasha was mind blowing. The biriyani could have been better. However overall my meal was a satisfying one and well worth the price . Food was well packed. Taste was on point and it was served hot. I would love to order again and definitely going to try our other items!

Both the rice were tasty nd tasted different from each other. So all in all loved this place. Next day they even call me to take the review of the foods. Loved this gesture. So if you are looking to order for some great chinese foods to nioy at ur place go for Cloud Kitchen..,positive

7584,"It is a quiet place which offers delicious Chinese dishes. The ambience is OK and staff's are good in behaviour. I have tried Crispy Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice with Garlic Chicken. The quantity is pretty good and from the taste point of view - A Big Thumb's up. A good place to dine in within normal budget.

Crispy Chicken -

Tasted good and I liked the way they garnished the dish. Chicken was soft and was less spicy with a taste of tangy sauce.

Mix Fried Rice -

It contained prawns, egg and normal veggies. Exotic chinese taste with balanced contents.

Garlic Chicken -

Chicken was soft and pcs were big. The gravy was tasty and not much spicy.

A small drawback is that few chicken dishes have similar kind of taste which needs to be improved otherwise it is a recommended place for chinese speciality.",positive

5813,"What happens when someone tries to give a fun twist to our traditional singaara or samosa - Samosa Time is born - brainchild of Ayan Choudhury (thanks a ton for the invite) - loved every bit of the unimaginable experimentation with our age old singaara..

Tried a #CHILLIMANGOLITCHI mocktail - loved it especially the perfect blend of the flavours..

The #ChickenKeema & #ChickenManchurian samosas were superb.. They also have egg & prawn samosas as well..

But for me the pick of the day was the dessert version of their samosas - #MALAIMAARKE is simply a mindblowing fusion to say the least - samosas are stuffed with #Gulabjamun & served hot garnished with #Rabri - yummilicious..

Unique fast food delicacies are available indeed at this joint - should go viral soon..

Their biryani is actually TASTY. I've tried their egg biryani, chicken tikka butter masala and raita.
All the 3 were equally good. The biryani was moist, not over-spicy, light and very tasty. All in all, a perfect biryani. The chicken pieces in the butter masala recipe were pretty succulent. The raita added a kick to the meal.
Their packaging is also commendable. Also, the food is healthy- they don't use dalda or any artificial colours.
Definitely an option if one is looking for some really good biryani.",positive

The Makhmali kabab (bhetki) is a house speciality and was a real treat. Special mention goes out to gondhoraj bhetki if white sauce doesn't scare you. The highlight of all the main dishes for me was the Booal kalia. If you care for dessert, the chocolate phidni is a must try. It is a place highly recommend. But have your alternate choices ready as they don't have all kinds of fishes available as listed in their menu. This was my only gripe.

I love the chicken schezwan rice of this place, and they make it extra spicy if you ask them to. The momo, chicken roll, veg roll, etc is also good. The staff is quite friendly.",negative
6066,"This place was suggested by one friends as an alternative to KFC so I had to try it out. I had ordered from Uber eats and got a pretty good deal of 4 boneless chicken strips at 60 bucks. I have to say the strips tasted almost like the ones at KFC, it just lacked the spices that they use. All in all, if you are on a tight budget, I would definitely recommend you to try this out.",positive

1998,"This review is particularly for this branch. We ordered the Cheese Garlic Potato Pop and the Chilli Garlic Spaghetti.

The ambience of this place is what I did not like. You can't sit and even whisper without the entire cafe knowing what you're talking about. Since no music was playing, it didn't help. The entire vibe is so different from the Tollygunge branch.

The Spaghetti was great. The pasta was cooked right and so were the vegetables. The Potato Pops were normal and I wouldn't recommend it.

Please add atleast one eggless dessert.

I'd visit Chaiwala again, but not this branch.",negative
7709,"This is a new restaurant in town which serves kerala, seafood, continental & Indian cuisines. The ambiance was really good. Sitting arrangement is also good. Low light & background music sets your mood. & they use live colorful fish for decoration. For starters we ordered chicken hot wings(280/). Chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy & spicy. Its a must try. For main course we had coriander rice (140/) and mutton uppu kari (450/). Mutton was very soft it's remind me the the taste of typical South Indian foods. We also ordered chicken lasagna which was full of cheese.. I loved it. For dessert we ordered ice cream sandwich & trust m it was the treat to your mouth which contains Brownie, vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce & caramel toppings... Overall it was a good experience.

8973,"Firstly, The Peerless Inn happens to be my favourite hotel. I have been staying here since 2006. For the first time I visited Oceanic for buffet dinner and I was tad disappointed. From the plethora of dishes, I restricted myself to Awadhi mutton biriyani accompanied by salan. Now, Hyderabadi biriyani does have salan as accompaniment but Awadhi? The biriyani was good and so was the salan. A new combination, rating of 4.5 is well deserved. I had a dish of fish but did not like the taste. So, 1 out of 5 there. The live counters of veg and non veg, especially for Kebabs were missing the chef. Was not able to taste them at 10:55 pm.
The desserts had 7-9 different varieties. Misti doi was typical to Bengal and it was good therefore. I liked the chocolate fudge very much.
The staff were polite and made the experience tolerable.
The price is very high.",negative
5879,"Seven of us decided to revisit Memory Lane in the form of Jimmy's Kitchen, last Sunday.

If there's one iconic dish that is most representative of Jimmy's, it is the Chilli Chicken, IMO. A couple of plates of these were ordered as starters and a long forgotten taste sensation reawakened. Simply stated, it was far and away the best chilli chicken I had tasted in a long, long time.

The Mixed Hakka Chow that came with Sweet and Sour Chicken next however, had way too much dark soya sauce and sort of broke the spell that the Chilli Chicken had woven. The Sweet and Sour was quite toothsome, though.

Next was the turn of the Mixed Gravy Chow, paired with Roast Chilli Pork. The Chow was okayish. Suffice to say, I've had better, elsewhere. The pork was well made certainly. I wish the meat had been less lean and chewy and the fat element, a little more.",negative

890,"My trip to Kolkata had been a short one but I wasn't going to miss out on an opportunity to have some local kulhadi chai and doodh cola while I was there.

A friend of mine had suggested that Balwant Singh's eating house was just the spot to come to late at night to battle the cold with some hot chai so go there we did. :)

The kulhadi chai is just amazing! Personally, I would recommend the sweet version because it brings out the taste of the tea and gives you the kick that you expect out of the chai. 

The doodh cola was really good! I hadn't had something of that sort before so my experience trying the drink for the first time was quite enjoyable! :) It's the perfect blend of full cream milk floating comfortably over half a cup of thumbs up/coke. The best part about this drink is that it tastes like it's been ice-blended so even if you aren't a big fan of milk, you'll never know the difference because of how natural the combo tastes!",positive

Ordered butter naan, roti, malai chicken kabab and mutton rogan josh. The kabab was okayish . But the mutton was not at all satisfactory. The naan was hard. All over not a very good experience. Service was okay.",negative
5589,"Ordered ghost rogan josh from this place. The gravy accompanying the two medium sized pieces of bony mutton was very tasty. The combination of sesame seed,cashew and poppy seed paste was mesmerizing. The gravy looked tantalizing due to its eye catching colour which was achieved by using Kashmiri Mirch in generous proportions though it made it a bit hot.However, all good work was spoilt due to the poor quality of mutton ,which is entirety unexpected from Saffron. I think this kind of hard, undercooked, bony mutton pieces only gives a bad name to the eatery. The management should be careful about it in future.",negative

1st of all Mixed fried rice did not contain any vegtables . I did not find any vegtables. Few chickens nd prawn .. even the taste was not so good
Coming to schezwan rice it was okay.
Kun pao chicken was tasty but the shredded chicken was not upto the mark.. the quantities are huge. But quality was not that good. We orderd 2 plates of fried rice for 3 people . We had not even finished the 2 plates becoz of its bad taste.
Total cost came out - 614 including gst

6314,"Had been to this place almost two weeks ago. It's located in Dhakuria just opposite a petrol pump, before the flyover to Gariahat.
At the beginning, we were served papad as complementary. We ordered Chicken Drums of Heaven, Butter Nan, Dal Makhani and Chicken Bharta. Drums of heaven had 6 pieces and was delicious and very spicy. It was the only saviour that day. Butter Nan was not prepared properly. It was uneven -very thick in certain areas and overtly crispy sometimes. Dal Makhani was average. I have had much better ones elsewhere. Chicken Bharta had shredded chicken and an egg. It wasn't upto the mark too. The pieces weren't fresh. Quantity was okay for two.
Ambience is average. Service is fine. Our bill amounted to ₹756. Don't think I would be visiting this place again.",negative

The chicken kosha was more than perfect in it's taste. Can be perfectly paired up with this sweet Basanti Pulao. The quantity was sufficient for two people. Price is also reasonable. Ambience was suitable for everyone and clean and beautiful.❤️😊",negative

9095,This place is situated near Indra Roy Road . From the name itself you may get the idea that it is a place where you can hunt for some good paranthas and it's true they serve quite a good variety of them ranging from Aloo Parantha to Cheese and Paneer Paranthas. But what bothers me is that the stuffings of the Paranthas does not taste good at all. The staffs are not at all bothered and I think they should improve the quality of food they serve. The seating capacity is descent but then the quality of food and gesture of staffs is what they are really lacking in. The prices are very much reasonable but then once they served me tea in a cup which was the most smallest possible plastic cup that can be found in the market and then charged me 25 bucks for such ridiculing preparation of an ordinary milk tea in that small cup which I felt was not at all worth it.,negative
1678,"Located in posh area of southern avenue where you see restaurants and cafes everywhere and standing as an unique with unique menu is very impressive.

Today we tried juicy minced chicken and exotic vegetables salad with plum dressing, melting cheese stuffed mushrooms, grilled pork chop, chocolate salami with chocolate mousse and ginger blast mocktail.

A must try. One of the best in town. Try once if you haven't tried it at all.

Quality of food is undoubtedly superb and seating arrangement is done perfectly looking after introvert, ambivert and extrovert people so that they can choose where to seat and enjoy their time with loved ones.

I find the interiors nice here, but my main problem here is, the hygiene. The glasses were not clean and I had to ask the staff to change the glasses, the service is something that can be worked upon to, by service I mean here the time they take to serve a dish, also when I ordered a few dishes they said it is not ready as it is early our of the day, these are the little things that can be worked upon.

Chicken Roll -

The hariyali kebab was decent and the biriyani tasted just like home-made biriyani..with no smell of 'attar' and absolutely light on the stomach, good for those who do not like the smell of attar and find biriyani to be heavy..but personally I felt that the absence of the smell took away the essence of biriyani. Overall an okayish experience.",negative

2666,"I've never been to the main outlet, but have always ordered via Swiggy. Swiggy service is the best. Coming to the food. I've ordered normal Kolkata Chicken biryani as well as the Hyderabadi one. Both of them are good. It's really hard to find Hyderabadi Biryani in Kolkata but I appreciate the efforts of this restaurant to make Hyderabadi biryani in Kolkata because Calcuttan are very particular about their biryani and the aloo in it. To make a biryani without aloo in Kolkata needs a lot of courage. Kudos to Biryanne and more. Although it's different from Hyderabadi Biryani but it tastes really good, rice spices and 2 pieces of chicken and 1 egg.
Keep up the good FO-RK. 😊",positive

The thali consisted for 3pc Chicken Curry, Basmati Rice, Dal, Sabji, Aloo bhaja, Papad, Chutney(Sweet). The chicken curry was absolutely delicious, the chicken pieces were of medium size with bones. The curry tasted tangy and spicy!! The dal with papad & aloo bhaja was very delicious too. I felt like I was eating homemade food after a long time. Last but not the least the tomato r chutney with aam sokto.. wow!! What an ending to the meal. Thank you Mutton Golbari!! 😍😍",positive

9701,"This place used to be our go to takeaway when I used to work at SDF building . We would either order online or take a walk to the outlet during our tea breaks. Apart from the Vada Pavs that I've had in Mumbai, this place had the best vada pavs I've ever tasted. They had a wide range of vada pav collections and I've probably had all vada pavs from the menu. We used to order with extra cheese and each one of the items were equally good.
After quiting my job 2 years ago I went back to visit my ex-colleagues and before heading back I went to have my favorite spinach and corn vada pav with extra cheese. However, the menu have completely changed and none of the new names impressed me enough. I ordered a hariali corn vada pav and it wasn't even close to the vada pavs I once used to have everyday. Imagine the disappointment. All I know is that if I'm visiting sector v for some work ever again, I won't be grabbing a bite from this place.

7809,"This happens to be a Chinese takeaway food joint, located near Acropolis mall.
They have excellent packaging including condiments.
However, the food though tasty, is way too oily.

I tried the Chicken and Shrimp Hakka Chowmein. The taste is overpowered by the strong oil content. Also, the prawns were over boiled, and lacked out on the slight subtle crispiness.
Taste: 3/5
Pocket Pinch: 130 bucks.

Moving on to the Hot Garlic Chicken, the concentration of the ingredients to the oil was negligible. The dish had oil floating all over, in addition to being way too chilly for Chinese standards.This needs way too much of improvement, and the dishes need improvement on their oil content all together.

combination of very good quality fish, properly prepared batter and exact frying in oil.The egg fried rice also had a unique taste which was further enhanced by the perfect balancing of sugar,salt,spice and oil.

At the price they are charging...they should include a soup/ Dal / Papad in their menu. The interiors are on a Bengali theme and so is the music. I was expecting more professional staff.....maybe explaining about destinations reached and about Bengali culture...etc. Since we took the Dinner slot ...could not see much view outside too.

7732,"OK! So this is a Hidden Gem in Sector 5, just beside the more famous Raize The Bar. But do give this restaurant a chance, u will not be disappointed. Moreover, they are also giving 45% off on Food right now! The place though small, have a nice ambience. It was almost empty when we went, but the DJ was playing with so much dedication for us, a handful of people. That day they were not serving Drinks, and they intimated us of the same as soon as we booked the table.
We also had a hookah and relaxed for long.
Coming to Food, we ordered:
Cream of Chicken and Basil Soup: The soup was so so creamy and tasty with adequate pieces of chicken. Enough for 2.
Soya Honey Sesame Chicken: Again a very good dish with right proportion of honey.
Afghani Chicken Risotto: Better than most places serving this.
Crunchy Darshan with Ice cream and Toffee Sauce: Quite satisfying.
Must try place, specially during offers! Once visited, would surely come back again!",positive

4387,"Ordered Chicken Pakoda (3pc) from Zomato last night. Got it for Rs.37 only. (50%off)

First of all it isn't pakoda. It's fried chicken. And i was amazed at the size of the chicken pieces! They were huge! Tastewise, you will like the first 2pieces very much, but eating the third piece, you will find it's getting boring and bland. However, the chicken filled my stomach, and I had to eat less during my dinner. 😂 As it was so rich and a heavy dish.

Anyway, their fried chicken was worth a try. It's almost similar to KFC. It didn't disappoint me. Hope I will order again soon.",positive
1002,"Straight out of The jungle book.. this place is the revamped version of previously called 'machaan'. Dining here is a different experience altogether. Decked up like a dense Forest, it has elements from real time bird and animal sounds to make believe waterfalls. Wooden seating brings a rugged look to the whole set up. We tried few of their signature cocktail and mocktails like Sher Khan Cooler, Bagheera's care and Forest mystic iced tea (LIIT). Tried one more charcoal grilled chicken kebab from their menu which I felt needs a little more variety. Otherwise the ambience makes up for this small loophole. All in all, a must try if you're looking towards an adventurous dining!",positive

The pepper chicken was boneless chicken pieces sautéed with bell peppers & onions - very hard n chewy. Fish finger was okay. Coming to main course. The noodles had some bad smell and again hard chicken pieces. Rice okayish. The Manchurian chicken balls had thick coating, floating in a red spicy gravy. Overall not up to the mark (quality n taste). Pocket friendly.",negative

The meifoon ( spelling in the menu is 'maifoon') was just terrible. It was all lumpy and sticky. For a moment I just forgot the real taste of meifoon. Mongolian chicken did not taste anything special. It tasted like any other dish of chicken. The only good thing we had was smoked lamb, atleast this one tasted better (although, it seemed more of roasted than smoked)!",negative
8704,I ordered 2 chicken biryanis and 1 chicken bharta for dinner. The quantity was good. But the taste....i must say i tasted the worst biryani ever. Actually biryani didnt have any taste just full of cloves. The chicken piece was very small and it didnt have anything on it. Chicken piece tasted as if just boiled. Now the potato... it was also just tiny with no taste atall. And they are charging 160 for such biryani. Overall horrible biryani. Bt bharta was good taste.,negative

The restaurant decor is quite nice with dim lights and chinese dragons.  It also has a separate seating area for large groups. It has a bit of china town feeling.

We ordered for apollo fish and it was yummy. The fish had no smell and was soft and delicious. We were so hungry that we gobbled up in a jiffy. 

Next we ordered for mixed chowmein and a chicken dish the name of which unfortunately i am unable to recall. The noodles tasted good but the chicken was very average and not worth the order. The server suggested the dish but it failed to impress both of us. Rather we had packed dragon chicken which was good but not that fiery like its name. Price is on the higher side however ambience is not bad . Service was good!

I was so so so impressed upon the taste and quantity that it forced me to give a review after so many years😄.

Ordered:
✔Spicy Chicken Pizza
✔Sterling Reserve B-7
✔Mint Hookah

The pizza was of thin-crust and was good in taste, they only have a single size pizza. If you come with a gang, and would tell them to divided it in equal pieces they will.

4419,"Location- Located at the Decker's lane

Orders- We ordered for the following dish
1. Chicken Stew

Serve- It was pretty Good took 5 Minutes (Approx).

Ambience- The ambience was decent, as the place was small and can be pretty congested sometimes but the shop is pretty well maintained compared to the other shop present in that lane.

Quality- The quality of the food was really good, as we thought that it might not be as hygienic as it is located in that sort of a small lane but it proved us wrong. 

Price- From the price point of view it is Reasonable,

Experience- It might seem that the shop is not located in a very good place but try giving it a visit and I am pretty sure that it will prove you wrong. And definitely try the chicken stew as it is really popular and delicious.

You should definitely give it a visit!!",positive
8899,The decor is quite attractive and price is affordable. So we visit this place quite often. Their cheese sauce pasta is actually cheesy. We tried it with chicken and sweet corn.

It's close to my college, so we have been there several times and we loved the place each time we've been there. The food is equally good. Pocket pinch is very student friendly and you get ample good food at a affordable price. Also the service is quick, neat and the staffs are so friendly. They ask for honest feedback as well after the service.

The rice was good and much oily. As it was a veg rice, so few veggies were present. Taste was very simple (nothing like chinese flavors) and kind of pulao. Quantity was good.

4 pcs of chicken were given (not so big) and were soft. The sauce was little bit sweeter but tasted good with rice.

Along with this combo, salad and french fries were given. The service was good. This outlet provide food in somewhat within budget and the taste is also good. One must try here atleast for once.",positive

6874,"Keeping the review crisp and short, since there is nothing much to write about it. 

   Basically it is a roadside food outlet as you have seen them throughout Kolkata. On a night, we decided to have a try from this joint through the Zomato Online Delivery. Since we had not much expectations, we had ordered to simple and well known dishes, namely the Egg Chicken Noodles and Chilli Chicken. 

   It took around 30 mins for the order to be prepared and around 15 mins for the delivery by the Zomato guy. Since most of you have tasted the roadside noodles and chilli chicken once in your life, you will find the taste exactly same. The egg and chicken quantity in the noodles was good, and the chicken pieces in the chilli chicken was normal. Although the noodles tasted fine, the chilli chicken tasted was somewhat on the down side. 

   So overall, you can try the food here with normal expectations having roadside restaurant taste.

We also tried out Ilish jhal and Pabda jhal. The gravy of Ilish had a bit too much of oil, but the quality of the fish was again top notch. And the same has to said about the pabda as well.

I ordered the Egg Double Chicken Cheese Roll. To begin with, I would have definitely liked some more pieces of Chicken in my roll. The top portion had enough big chunks, but as I went downwards, the size kept decreasing and the last 2 bites didn't have any Chicken pieces. Size of the roll is great. Wonderfully oil fried Lachha Paratha used to prepare the roll. Cheese portion could be more generous.

Price, I thought is slightly on the higher side. I paid 101/- for the roll, which I thought should have been priced around 80 bucks.

I tried to pay the amount through card. The person at the counter lied blatantly and said they don't have card option. However unfortunately for him I could locate the card swiping machine and requested him to use it as I wasn't carrying cash on me. He lied again and said that they don't accept card below orders of 300, which I found quite unbelievable. They need to get rid of this reluctance towards card payments.",negative

On one of the rainy evenings , I was craving for some tasty and spicy food. From zomato I found out this place and placed my order.

I ordered chicken tangri , chicken tikka masala and tandoori roti.

We ordered spring roll and pasta for food both of which were quite good especially the spring rolls and we ordered for liit and daiquiri for drinks which again was very well made. Overall a great experience, lived up to its standards. The only thing which disappointed me a little was that i had informed about the birthday of the person i was with and i was told a complimentary dessert would be done but nothing was done about it. This was something not expected of a reputed restaurant. But their overall service was quite satisfactory and i would still recommend this place for a nice evening.",positive
10087,"I made an online order for veg pulao with raita and sambhar. The rice used in pulao seemed to be of poor quality and barbati was used instead of beans. The raita was too sweet and the sambhar was OK. My points go to the ease of order, quick delivery and the less spicy and oily food. It's almost impossible to get good veg food from a vegetarian restaurant in strand road area. Just improvements in quality of good and ingredients can earn the restaurant a 5*",negative

1016,Visited this place one week back with my mom after shopping at new market. This was my first visit to this plate. I had the desire of having their kati rolls but settled down with biriyani and chicken bharta and naan. Taste was okayish. Biriyani was light. Nothing over the top. Somehow felt the price is on the higher side with respect to quantity that they serve.,negative

We tried few of their delicacies
Coriander Fish Finger
Salt n Pepper American Corn
Cheese Balls
Margherita Pizza
Charmoula Chicken
Veg Mexican Rice Jacket Potato

My favourites were coriander Fish Finger , charmoula chicken , cheese balls and salt and pepper corn.

I was told tht the biriyani would b suficient for 3 persons but when i opened the box i found it was only for 2 nd they charged it 212. Even the quantity of aloo biriyani was not suficient.

Lets come to its taste. The biriyani was not that much tasty as it should have been. Itts as if something was missing. The pieces of chicken were salt less, over cooked. I had a very bad experience on the first order.",negative

In love with their packaging, truly how corporate lunches should be served.
Love their poha platter served with fruits and upma platter served with sprouts salad.
The veg cheese sandwich is also truly amazing, and so as their healthy meal which has baked beans and toast along with coffee. The coffee delivered is pretty amazing. Have also tried all dum and kachodi which was okay. The partha thali was too heavy.

Though their lunch menu looks boring but the breakfast menu keeps calling me over and over again.",positive

What can I say there was not a single thing to find fault with. The biryani was delish, the mutton piece juicy, tender and melt in mouth, the mutton chap was exquisite, the firni truly rich in its taste.

6061,"Ordered through foodpanda. First ordered mutton steak. And then subsequently ordered peri peri grilled chicken. For some strange reason mutton steak got confirmed then got cancelled. However, peri peri chicken was confirmed. It was foodpanda. So I knew it was useless to complain and left the delivery time to luck. Food got delivered after 90 minutes. Now coming to the packaging, it was extremely poor. Can you imagine the gravy was packed along with the chicken, rice and chips together in a paper box. Everything got messed up when I opened the box and the gravy was leaking. Now the taste, i love spicy food (and that's why I ordered peri peri chicken) but no matter how much ever you adore spicy food, it is still difficult for your taste buds to tolerate a dish made with 100gms of pepper. Very poor experience. Perhaps not going to order again. Much better continental places around.",negative

We ordered Kiwi & Pomegranate Bellini for drinks and really loved it. This is definitely a must try. For food we ordered French fries, Pizza Margherita and Mezze platter. Finally it was the dessert which bowled us over. Their Hazelnut Mousse is absolutely amazing. A bit on the expensive side, but should definitely be visited.",positive

One of the oldest institutions that probably need a marketing overhaul and a little bit of adjusting to the modern palates of Bengalis. Overall, food was good.",positive

I threw away the entire food...And trust me it was not at all beef also...cause the beef is a bit red or blackish red, it can't be so pinkish...

and simple logic is, when mutton is 560 INR/Kgs in kolkata, how can someone sell 2pieces of mutton in just Rs.80

Also ordered their drums of heaven which was not that good. The sauce it was made on was a mixture of sweet and sour taste but there was no tinge of chicken but was filled with maximum batter stuffing. But I will keep ordering their gravy chowmein. Must try!

2)Re-ordered again : This time their chicken lollipop and ofcourse their gravy chowmein. Chicken Lollipops are better than drums of heaven. And this time the chowmein was more awesome than the previous time. With lots and lots of veggies, chicken , mushrooms and corns. Yumm!",negative

Loved their mutton kosha succulent soft pieces of mutton cooked in spicy gravy
Biryani was not upto the mark very bland in taste

I ordered chicken tangri kebab and chicken tikka kebabs to go with my beer. I dint find the food fresh and price of the drinks was on average side .. they do have happy hours menu on drinks but beer are not included there, I hope they include it soon..

Also, the last time we went during the pujas, we ordered burnt garlic rice, which never had even a hint of garlic in them.

The ambience is great along with large variety of board games. I didn't mind waiting for the food ( it did take some time) at all because I was having great fun playing Pictionary. The service overall is good.

We ordered the Fresh Tomato Pesto Pizza. Order this pizza only if you know you like pesto. The taste is quite strong and it took me a little while to appreciate the taste. That being said though, it's a good pizza.

I like the honesty of the place. They made the ambience in a way other cafes try but fail. They take their time with the pizza but the crust is good, the cheese is generous and the toppings are fresh ( although the pizza is a little small).

I'll definitely visit again and try other items from the menu. I hope to see proper eggless desserts by that time.",positive

Coming to the food, I ordered a chicken sandwich along with a brownie milkshake to start off. I found the milkshake really good as i could feel the brownie being properly grinded and mixed smoothly to give such a fine taste. The sandwich was good, although i felt it was missing something such as a coleslaw on the side or mayo inside the bread ; still was good. I then ordered an Affogato to finish it off. Originally given with a sciop of vanilla ice cream, due to unavailability of Vanilla ice cream, I was given a chocolate scoop which surprisingly tasted better.

I love the fact that they are trying to keep the tradition alive and don’t let you take a spoon or knife to eat. I have tasted their specialty the Raan which is absolutely melt in the mouth meat with khasta roti and would recommend the same for the uninitiated.",positive

I ordered fried rice and chicken curry, this restraunt took around 15 minutes to accept the order. Then after an hour they called me and told that fried is not available kindly opt for aloo rice means it was already 22:20 know I had no choice as all the restraunt would be closed so I opted but is this the way a customer is treated online. Means an order placed an hour before is finished as he was unable to see on his app my food order😂😂😂😂. Kindly check before online order as this was my second encounter with this restraunt. Even the aloo rice was biryani and rice was undercooked.",negative

But as you will jeep entering you will find a comfortable decor with AC. Went there only for alcohol with few of my friends. The thing which I didn't like was that they never asked what amount of vodka or whiskey would we like they simply gave 60 ml to everyone. The kingfisher storm was not good. Didn't like that beer. It was very fizzy. The chakhna they gave was sufficient. Else everything was good.

We had-
Masala Dosa- it was just perfect and they are great at their service. As we had ordered for the masala to be seperate but they got it together. The supervisor made them change it before we even complained.
Onion Chilli Cheese dosa- I was actually scared to order this because I am not much fan of onion. But the perfect balance of onion chilli and cheese was just great.
Kulfi Falooda- that's another one which I just fell in love with. The falooda and the cream was not very sweet but soothing. And there was a lot of dry fruits topping.

It was not barbecued properly they just added masala over prepared paneer n mushroom and packed without barbecue. Taste was eating raw food.
Decided not to blow up our head and left the food and moved for airport with bad taste . In Kolkata restaurant serves good on tables but pathetic food on delivery , it's every where . I had experience this many times during my vacation.

The taste was flat and I hardly found any egg pieces as it was a egg chowmien. I think they use one egg for 2 or 3 plates of chow. The chilly chicken and two pieces of chicken momo was ok compared to the chowmien however there was hardly any gravy with the chilly chicken. The momo was not warm.

3803,"I have Visited this restaurant after 5 years. Must say they are improving their recipe, food quality and taste. Pocket friendly bengali food but one thing they should improve that is cleaning today I have found a dead baby cockroach floating over the Chutney it was disgusting but still I will give you 3 because all the dishes were well prepared. Today I have ordered rice, spcl dal, chanar dalna, fulkopi, aar mach, aam chutney And it costed me around 341 bucks. Nice experience after long time but not a hygienic place so a big thumbs down for it 👎 .",negative

5022,Well well well this review is quite a late one but I had to post as I celebrated my this year's bday at this place. This is my first visit to this place and it proves to be quite a memorable one. Ambience and environmental is top notch. Food's quality is as per price. Not something over the top. Pricing is Ok and if you r giving a treat it won't burn a hole in your pocket!!! If someone wants to spend some chillax time with friends or colleagues this is the place to be. Much better than many other places in this sector 5 area. The only thing they can work upon is to increase the space. That's it.,positive
1226,Kaafila is a afgan theme restaurant in Kolkata. Ambiance is nice. Their biryani is not authenticate Kolkata style but test wise it is good and one plate sufficient for medium appetite people. Mutton Shami kabab was delicious. Well behaved stuff.,positive
6760,While i was exploring for new places to eat i got referred to this place by a friend living in golpark. It's quite a small place consisting of a dining area and a confectionery type display just after the entrance gate. The food quality was okayish. I would not rate this place high.,negative

We initially ordered basanti pulao and alu dam combo bt then they told us alu dam was finished so they'll provide us with dhokar dalna.
Amount of polao was quite impressive and both the dishes tasted very good.
This combo we availed at 100 bucks which is also pocket friendly.",positive
10216,Worst place worst food worst behaviour and even prices are very high with very little choices. The owners behaviour is so rude worth commenting on.,negative
5655,"I quite liked their egg thali. Unlike most restaurants who skimp on the portion of rice, Rannaghar sent very generous portion.I liked the dal which had nuts in it, the 'jhuribhaja', and the egg curry(2 eggs) as well. Well, ofcourse, I would have preferred some sabzi other than bhindi, but overall, it was satisfying.

Edit- I have re-rated them to reflect their perceived lousiness in dispatching orders. Encouraged by their previous delivery, I ordered 'Elahi veg thali'. They didn't pack chutney. Now if you do not have the attention span to pack all the items meticulously, why keep such an elaborate option? The thali costs 220 and chutney alone costs 50/-.

And if their idea was to skimp and cheat, then this re-rating has been bang on buck.",negative
10469,This restaurant has a well decorated ambience with proper sitting capacity. The main attracting point is its open air arrangement. Only dissapointing one is the non availability of food. Teaste is not that bad overall a good place to hang out if getting together with a nice ambience is main priority.,negative
869,"Fabulous place for oriental fare. We started off with sweet and spicy crispy chicken and drums of heaven. The eight treasure soup was a hidden treasure and it was the best thing we tasted that night. Pad thai, nasi goreng, work tossed noodles,  thai lamb in kaffir lime, General Taos chicken were our mains. Hot chocolate rolls with icecream and rambutan with icecream brought the much loved meal to a desired end. Even the fresh lime sodas and the drinks were unusually good. A place to revisit",positive

We gave the order of chicken hariyali kabaab. It was served hot,juicy inside and well garnished. Then we had chicken biriyani, mixed fried rice and lemin chicken. All the items were good. The biriyani need a special mention here, it was so tasty, less oily and served hot with raita.
At last we placed the order of sea water mocktail it was very close to a well known blue lagoon. The hot gulab jamun with ice cream was really good in taste.
Overall a well outing it was and would like to visit it again. The only flaw which i could mention is that they took around 20 mins to get the food ready, other than that all ok.",positive
7179,"I placed order at 9.41pm and received at 11.05pm. I thought food will be good as it was much awaited but literally I was disappointed. I ordered spicy Asian veg bao and padthai noodles from this outlet. When I saw the bao my expectations get herts as it came as a size of a single dumpling and cost Rs. 89/- each. I tried bao from lots of other restaurants but i never had such a small size like this. Also the quantity of padthai noodles was too less which just broke my heart. If anyone could suggest me a tagline for this restaurant on behalf of my expirence I would suggest ""Wastage of money and time"". If you have extra money and wondering where to waste then this restaurant is definitely made for you.",negative

901,"This is a good option for people interested in vegetarian food other than the staples that are tagged onto menus in restaurants better known for their fish and meat dishes. The thali system offers a wealth of options - if anything, there is too much food served to you. During our visit, we had to choose carefully in order to be able to take seconds of the things we liked most and not overeat. In particular, the alu-bhindi (a common dish not usually noted), a Rajasthani daal (which reminded me of kadhi), the daal-baati-churma, and a halwa with apples stood out among the rest. There was also an excellent garlic pickle on the side.

The service was good and the ambience quite pleasant. However, it might be a good idea to let diners know in advance the number of dishes that would be served, along with descriptions of the less familiar ones. Overall, I liked the place and would visit again.",positive

Main Course~
1)Mutton Handi Biriyani~The biriyani tasted amazing and was quite good in quantity.The mutton pieces were boiled and was decent in size.The rice was properly boiled and spices were appropriate.

Dessert ~
1)Phirni~Had a thick texture throughout and tasted really amazing and ended our meal on a drooling note.

The gravy noodles were fine as per my taste buds. But though it was mixed, we missed eggs, however chicken and pork pieces along with prawns (read shrimps) were there. When asked why egg is not there, the waiter mentioned they don't give eggs in the mixed items... I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT LOGIC!!
And one plate can hardly suffice one hungry soul.

I would recommend this place for a 1 time try.",positive
5062,Went there for team dinner. It is much much recommended for a team dinner as it is pocket friendly and the dishes were good according to money spent.

9199,A really great eatery. Delicious food. Good staff behavior. Though the decor is kind of shady but it's not bad after all. The bill won't pinch your pocket at all. I loved their chilli garlic pork dish. It's basically a Chinese eatery. Be here for the food. You won't be disappointed. The only bad part is they take a little time to serve but that can be compromised with. I loved it.,positive

The ambience is creatively pleasing and the seating is appealing and comfortable. The use of dolls garnishes the decor and gives the place a homely feel.Personally, I liked their music and cutlery.  For food, I ordered chicken hot and sour soup and  chicken maeun dakbonggui! The preparation was delicious. The chocolate paan, which was served as a mouth freshener was paan-tastic (fantastic). Overall, the experience was refreshing and I’ll certainly visit them again!",positive

Ordered their Veg Noodles & Chicken Manchurian combo for Rs. 89 only. The food was delivered super fast within few minutes in super hot condition.

Veg Noodles were made very authentic Chinese style with crunchy vegetables. Thick noodles tossed with very mild spices tasted very neutral.

Chicken Manchurian was spicy with thick gravy and coriander leaves on top for garnishing. 2 medium sized chicken pieces, tasted juicy and fresh with full of flavours.

I liked everything about this place except the quantity of Noodles. Noodles were delivered in a small foil pack unlike contains and quantity was very low. It can be managed as evening snack but definitely not for lunch or dinner.",positive

However, due to the lack of a proper dance floor barring the private party arena, people usually dont get into the groove. The quality of the drinks isn't that great and can be improved. The food quantity is a bit less but very tasty. The lasagna is great but less in amount and so is the pizza. However, the starters are just out of this world. I tried all the beers. None made a great impression. However the Martini was great. The 'Sex on the Beach' & 'Virgin Pinacolada' were pretty ordinary. P.S. Do request a song to the DJ",positive

I had asked for Saturday shake for the variety of it, but the maître de table looking at my condition, suggested saffron and almond milk. It was thick and wonderful to taste. It cooled me and at the same time rejuvenated me.
It was a different atmosphere. Almost a gurukul like feeling, the aroma of exotic spices add to its beauty. The books for reading consist mainly of classic books, self help books and books on yoga. The menucard looks like a monthly magazine. The menu predictably consist of healthy food excepting cold coffee with ice cream.

It was Bhai- phota, so we brothers and sisters decided to have Biriyani, thus we ordered seven to eight packs of Biryani from A1 Haji, Baranagar, it was a great disappointment. The Biriyani rice, smelled awfully bad, the chicken pieces were also smelling badly, the potato was not boiled properly. It seemed that it was made a day or two before, and they served us that. Probably the Street Biryani Counters make much great biriyani than them. It extremely disappointed me, nobody could had their lunch that day.
And then when we went their to complain they refused to exchange. After arguing a bit, one of the staff said that they will exchange only two packs of Biriyani, we agreed on that too. But after coming back home, we realised that they gave us the same one by just serving it hot.

My opinion is that, take a bit extra money, but serve good food atleast.

Not at all recommended.",negative

9280,"Ordered chicken chowmein and schezwan chicken through zomato online order. Delivery was Swift and hassle-free. However the food wasn't upto the mark. The chowmein seemed like a home cooked one, just like we make at home. Nothing like a restaurant style Chinese noodle. And the schezwan chicken was not good too. The gravy was too oily and tasted nothing like a good schezwan chicken. Bland and tasteless.
The restaurant needs to take care of the quality on a serious note.",negative

In the food we ordered Potato wedges and Murg Kashmiri kebab. Potato wedges were very tender and it tasted really good with the dips it was served with. The kebabs were soft too and tasted good.

Would have loved to give a higher rating, if not for the inconvenience caused by the restaurant. They just cancelled my order (for apparently no reason) even after the Zomato valet confirmed about the same and asked me about my location. When it was quite a time, I checked my order and found it to be cancelled. Then I repeated my order (but unfortunately this time the promo code didn't get applied and I had to pay Rs 150 more). But atleast the Zomato chat support helped and credited 100 credits in my account for the hassle caused. I am not disappointed with Zomato but highly disappointed with Zaikebaaz for the trouble caused. Had they not cancelled the order, I would have had 150 rs off. The food is good, but I wish the service is improved.",negative

Went on a weekend was fully crowded as well as queue there, but still got the table quickly.
A restaurant can only stand out when there is a constant balance between quality and consistency.
And Cream center has justified the above mentioned category. The quality of food, courteous staff and warm hospitality speaks volumes about the brand.
It serves vegetarian cuisine in the city which is dominated by carnivores.
It serves mainly continental and north Indian cuisine, sizzlers as well as Bambaiya chaats.
We had ordered for Macroni, Nachos and a mocktail.

The staff is courteous, however they messed up with our order and served us a starter meant for someone else. Although the starter was very tasty, neither did they apologize for this, nor did they offer to make it a complimentary dish, since it was entirely their mistake. The Smoked Chicken Pizza and the Pepperoni Pizza were great. Long Island Iced Tea is quite strong here with respect to other places, but its awesome. The Caipiroska was also great. There is a large screen for sports screening. The overall experience was good, barring the starter incident. The place is a bit dark inside, hence front flash is a must for selfie freaks.",negative

On a very unlucky day where they were out of Pork Items, mainly the ones I have heard so much about, I decided to have Chicken Bao, Grilled Bhetki, Dry Chilli Chicken and few other dishes paired with a glass of neat scotch. Both the fish and the chicken melted in my mouth and you could enjoy the royalty of a Kolkata Bhetki. The staff was cordial and always smiling as if to fill up the void that was created in my heart because of no Pork. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.",positive

8670,"I know of this popular Hedua restaurant for many years but have never happened to dine here. So I chose this to treat a few new friends last evening.

The interior is modest but presentable with all sofa seating. Service staff is attired. I went for Chinese as this place is known for this cuisine. I ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Chowmein and Schezwan Chicken on the side. The portion size of the rice and noodles was good but the taste was average, so they didn't justify the prices. The side dish had twelve not-so-large pieces of chicken. The meat was chewy and the gravy a bit too hot though I had specified otherwise.

We rounded it off with ice cream. They had only one flavour- vanilla. So I asked to bring it with chocolate sauce poured over. They put some nuts too. It tasted good but a price of Rs 130 was quite a premium.

I won't be keen to come back.

Must Try:
- Lepchi Kai Chicken- their signature dish- huge chunks of succulent chicken 

- Lemon Garlic Soup (choice of Chicken/Mixed/Veg): basically clear soup but with lots of gaflic and kafir lime. Perfect starter for a winter meal, or in case you are looking for some relief from the wheezing and cold congestion.

Pros: Affordability Every dish is cooked to perfection.

It doesn't have a fancy ambiance given the price tags
The sambhar felt tad too liquid and both the sambhar and the coconut chutney lacked the typical flavor
The paper dosa was much smaller than expected, also the waiter couldn't explain the differences between some dosa options
The uttapam was crunchy on both sides, I don't mind crunchy at all but the inside was still mushy as if in a hurry they had cooked at a very high temperature while the inside did not get cooked properly. It wasn't too bad but I don't expect my uttapam to melt and fall",negative

And after waiting for so long all we got was one while we had ordered 2. We were so disgusted that finished the one and left. Our expectations were high, and we did not like the place at all.

Let's come to the foods i had today, i ordered veg hakka noodles with chicken manchurian added with mixed fried rice. I have to say the chow's quality was damn good, and cooked very well and they mixed a lot of veggies. The chicken manchurian was good but it was a bit salty, the pieces of chicken were very good there's no sign of floured mixed ones and last not the least the mixed fried rice was superb and delicious 😋, chicken, prawn, eggs and vegetables were added to the rice's ratio to compensate the amount.

The biggest disappointment was the pork belly. The crackling on top was a disaster, it was a leathery mess. The meat and fat should have been rendered better than it was when served. It was inadequately seasoned to top it off. However , the accompanying broth was good to taste.

I tried their Special Tea along with Samosa, Nimki and Balusai as snacks. Samosa was average, they served it with sweet chutney. Nimki was okey too but Balusai was extremely dry and tasted absolutely pathetic. Coming to their Tea, it was really special with full of flavours.

They also serve dhaba style main courses and pricing is cheap too. This place is a must drop if you're wondering to have tea while passing by BT Road.",negative

Masala Dosa & Lemon Rice @ Krijuss, Kolkata ☺

Situated around the junction of Phool Bagan and Beliaghata, Krijuss is a recently opened vegetarian restaurant that serves - South Indian, Chinese and Sandwiches.

Being always on the lookout for good South Indian outlets, I parcelled Krijuss's Masala Dosa and Lemon Rice for tasting.

The Dosa came with the customary Sambhar, Coconut Chutney and Onion-Tomato Chutney.

The Masala Dosa was uniformly cooked without any burning around the edges and had enough Aloo Masala stuffing inside. The Onion-Tomato Chutney was fresh and tasted better than most of the other local South Indian eateries. The other two accompaniments were average. The entire dish tasted nice.

The Lemon Rice was infused with enough peanuts and curry leaves. It was well cooked and tasted good. The quantity parcelled was more than enough for one person.

Price of Masala Dosa: Rs. 90/-
Price of Lemon Rice: Rs. 70/-

6096,"This place is extremely superb for your weekend dining plan. It is located on the 1st floor of Hotel O2 Oxygen, Kaikhali.
• A classy ambience they have & you can have the wonderful flavour of candle light on every Saturday and Sunday with the melody of live violinist.
• Let's talk about the food, O2 Hotel is always on the top of the foodie's favourite wishlist.
The chef has the magic in his hand. The must try items of them are: Tandoori Mix Non Veg Platter, Grilled Chicken, Grilled Fish, Mutton Rogan Josh with Rice & from the dessert section Baked Alaska (Flambe) has made me fall in love with it.
They have a long range of extraordinary cocktails from their bar section too.
• Staffs are really very courteous and professional. They have a great idea on the best way to satisfy their customers.
• Music by the violinist was magnificent, that had made our evening.

Had scotch with Caesar salad and chicken wings. The wings were delicious and the Caesar salad was perfect.
Also had their thin crust Hawaiian pizza.Turned out its their specialty.The grilled chicken toppings were tender and juicy.The veggies were fresh and crunchy.Pineapple chunks gave it a citrus twist.
Nice experience.",positive
827,"Rated 4* because of the interior design, ambiance, bar counter, sitting decor. But if i talk about the food quality, quantity and taste they should work on it. Because i have had same dishes much more tastier in other places that too in a low budget. So i shouldn't say that there menu has got something different and excellent. Cocktails also like it was good but nothing exceptionally amazing. If you guys can upgrade the food menu, quality, quantity and taste then it will just go hand in hand with the rest of the qualities that i have mentioned above. I just loved the interior of this restaurant, dim light, good musiz, perfect for boozing.",positive
5060,"Last month me and colleague went to this restaurant which is very near to our office. Its mainly famous for Chinese cuisine and although now they have started serving North- Indian or Mughai dishes. Apart from that its having a bar which is a real plus point for those who want to take a drink along with good food.

Ambiance is very good. With great interior design and good seating arrangement.

We ordered Chicken biryani and Chicken tikka masala. Chicken biryani is very tasty and flavourfull although its slightly on richer side.
Chicken tikka butter masala also very yummy and spicy. The kebaab used in chicken tikka butter masala gravy was on decent side.
Overall had great lunch
Total bill for one chicken biryani, chicken tikka butter masala, one papad and two cold drinks was around ₹998/-",positive

3198,One of the best food joints for quick bites specially their rolls- unlike other places their rolls are not dipped into a kadai of oil. They are made of rumali roti and along with others stuffings they add mayonnaise which gives the item altogether a totally different and lipsmaking taste (a must try). Their other items are also delicious but I really didn't like their jungly biriyani- too oily and lots of chilies were used to make it spicey and less of actual spice was used.,positive
10455,Today I ordered roti and mushroom masala for my dinner from this outlet.after put an order I just called them immediately and requested for a good packaging. Then they asked about anything to customize it. After few minutes I called my delivery guy to to give the correct location details and o got my order with in 15mins. The food was delicious. The rotis were hot and soft and the mushroom is simply awesome in taste. Further I got a call from this people for the taste and quality. It is undoubtedly the best deal near by. This is my second order from this outlet and in future o am going to order many more. Appology for not uploading any pics as I was good damn hungry.,positive

Forgot the singer's name, but he had a lovely voice (a perfect 5 for him). Shifting to food, they had a huge spread (Chinese items were less). Bengali dishes and desserts were really delicious. My personal favourites were 'chingri cutlet', 'chanar curry', 'bhetki pur bhaja' but the 'chocolate pan' took my heart away. They were even gifting a special 'subha saradiya' cake to all the customers. A lovely gesture! #happytummydays",positive

Now I understand slow service if you have a full house but there was no one around except us . Maybe the Service guys had taken a nap  The masala vada was also not to my liking With all the wrong spices and almost cold and oily . I've had much better ones at various other south Indian food joints in the city. Aloo paratha was dry and The coffee too was so mild that the aroma of south Indian filter coffee was missing.

The seating area is very spacious and spread out quite well with couple seats (1+1) and others for groups and families. The decor is quite beautiful too with flowers and hand crafted designer lamps it makes it all the more beautiful.

The service is quite quick, the staff is polite, however some are still learning so they might need a repetition while you're ordering which isn't a big drawback.

The food quality is good. It tastes quite decent, it's not the best but it's not too bad either and a single dish or portion is enough for a person and sometimes even two people can share it and it's enough for two. The prices are pretty reasonable too, quite easy on the pocket. A lunch for two will be somewhere around 400 which is very reasonable.",positive

We ordered fresh lime, polao, mutton daakbunglow and fish kabiraji. The entire food was served in two halves. for the first lot the kabiraji was absolutely yummy. the fresh lime was nice. the mutton was nicely cooked and the polao was also fresh. however for the next set. the mutton served tasted different. the curry was not similar to the earlier set. the fresh lime was not good. we saw lump of salt piled up at the bottom in each glass. overall the location is good. but taste and service needs to be improved a lot else after few years they wont exist in this competition.",negative

Aloo dum, which taste too good, it cooked with scrambled paneer and green peas. 
They also provide salad, green chilly chutney, one masala papad and raita.

Now coming to the food, ordered mixed schezwan rice and a plate of chicken do piyajaa..I liked the chicken and it had an unique homemade feeling to it..Now the rice was good but it could have been better...The quantity is great...I felt the oil ratio on the food could have been less..nevertheless..it was good !!",positive

Ambience: Comfortable texmex with well spaced couches and the entire place is in transparent with an outside view. The bar lies at the corner. At the entrance the case of vintage liquer and the wall adds to the grandeur.
Food: Honestly one of the best places I have eaten at this season.
Ordered a house caesar salad and crispy fried chicken with flavored vodka. The salad was great with great amounts of chicken. The crispy chicken was magnamanious 3 pieces served with that perfect dip.
Hospitality was top notch. Service was fast and prompt.
5 star it is.
Will go back to try main course and dessert.",positive

Believe me everyone should try it. I'll suggest you to get a parcel rather than sitting and eating. And the biriyani is another delicacy here. Not to mention the pocket pinch is very much moderate, these guys serve quality with quantity and has been successful in maintaining their signature taste.",positive
1876,"One of the best pizza I had in Kolkata and the closest to a classic Italian pizza, obviously because it is made the original way with brick oven. They have the olive oil kept away but will give you the bottle if you just simply ask for it. The cheese pull was good and with Zomato gold, you feel like coming to eat here everyday.",positive
7511,"I went to the renowned Das Cabin with a few of my friends because I had a sudden craving of having Fish Kabiraji. On arriving, we found out that none of the fish items were available. We were disappointed but since it was during Pujo, it was kind of understandable, so we ordered for Chicken Kabiraji and Mughlai Paratha instead. But what was not acceptable was that they were cutting onions without any sort of functional exhaust or chimney facility and two of my friends had to walk out of the place because their eyes were unbearably burning. Also, after receiving the food we felt that this place was overrated. Maybe this food joint was legendary once but the food quality has deteriorated a lot since then. The food quality and quantity were just okay, nothing that is amazing or touches your soul.",negative

If you are lucky enough, you could come across some tollywood star sharing the dancefloor with you. The security is very strict which you wont find in most of the clubs of kolkata. The ambience inside and the decor is incredible. The staffs too are cordial but it usually takes longer time than usual to get your order ready.

Just ordered 2 veg momo(6pcs each) via ‌zomato. They served soup also. They charged 5 rupees each for packaging but the packaging was very very normal just like the sweet shop packets.

Let's come to the food.
It tastes just ewwwwww😖😖😖😖
TERRIBLE😭😭
The veggies inside was raw,kachha bilkul
The smell was so bad, *but it was not rotten*,all by god's grace😇
It had some unpleasant taste. I didn't like it at all.
But the soup was good 👍

But refuel, i will remember this.

8599,"I love this small take-away counter at Beliaghata Joramandir. They call it HonKong Fried Chicken. HFC is a promising alternative to KFC, where we get crispy crunchy fried chicken, akin to the latter, at very low prices. Burgers are also very tasty, with a crunchy chicken patty between the bread. There is enough reason to come back for more!
The chicken is quite tender and juicy, the batter is a bit under-fried at times, else their items would be indifferentiable from KFC's.
Great job HFC!",positive
11098,"They ask for service charge when they don't even have staff. The food is not hot. They don't even serve cold drinks in glass, then how can they charge Rs 500 while we ourselves have to pour it in small glasses from the bottle. Had to serve them myself as they had requested me to help due to the shortage of Staff(do not help in restaurant, ever. They don't consider help). Overpriced. 
Can you see a jain menu. They charged 175 for Rs 155 sandwich(make it your sandwich without cheese)
And then they say 10%discount on service charge which is optional. I choose not to pay as it was a buffet which was again accepted because of shortage of staff. 
Totally dissatisfied with food and services and pricing.",negative

In frame :

Saucy Chicken wings
Cheesy Zinger Burger

Popcorn Chicken

Well coming to the food... This is absolute value for money.. The burgers have their own signature style and extremely easy on the palette as well.. The saucy chicken is totally different with chicken wings doused in the house special sauce with garlic and schezwan infused flavours. Finally the popcorn chicken also does a neat job. The peri peri sauce is also not too spicy and goes well with the Indian foodie sentiments.Alsp the packaging is a big plus with cute doodles on the popcorn chicken boxes.Definitely a do not miss outlet...

They have expanded the area a bit since the last time I visited. It was more or less empty the few times I visited, but the food is satisfying enough.
I've tried their octopus, squid , pork, crab and pan fried chowmein which is okay and Indonesian rice which is good.
The squid in honey chili was very tasty although I'd have liked less batter.
Octopus is nice.
Pork is chewy and feels a little stale.
Crab is ok but not very meaty.
Overall a good option for a lunch out.",positive

So all in all a very good place for Parantha lovers.
They have good number of varieties and also the price is not that expensive.",negative
2925,"This is a great restaurant if you are looking for a la carte as well as buffet. They serve the buffet on the barbeque grill which is placed on the table. Weekdays dinner charges are 680 for veg and 780 for non veg including taxes. Service and ambience was great. Although they could add few more starters and also deserts to the buffet. Main course was decent. Although it's not at all better than the barbeque nation but in case you want to have great barbeque buffet at decent price then this is the place. But I still feel at this price they could have added few more starters and also improve the quality of the starters compared to other barbeque buffet restaurants.

Chicken Noodles- The noodles was average in taste. There could have been a little more authenticity in the taste and the quantity of chicken shreddings.

Chilly Chicken- The taste was good. We ordered the gravy chilly chicken and the quality was commendable along with the quantity. The price was tad-bit high though.

Chicken Tandoori- Despite the proportion being good, the chicken was not ar all tender and succulent. The mint chutney was disappointing on it's part.

We also wanted to order Beer but they have certain rules regarding registrations in their club. Without a membership code of their club one is not allowed to order drinks. That's really a filthy rule cause everyone landing up for rewinding might not have a membership code. That's something which requires a change.",negative

That's what it's all about.

Barring paneer chutkule, none were palatable, couldn't eat much of it and had to waste most of it.
We even had iced tea and sweet lime soda, which were a saving grace for this horrible lunch.

8839,"Overall it's a good . A typical Panjabi hotel with typical desi taste. All items are more or less good. But there speciality is spices which they add in dishes.
I ordered chiken tikka kabab(6 pieces) which was not so good, chiken was no soo tender but yes it was juicy. Spices were amazing.
But the all time favourite from them is nun, lassi and butter chiken.
Located exactly next to the phulbagan SBI",positive
6846,"Flavours is one of the oldest street food places in the vicinity. Basically they have picked their name from the restaurant flavours which does not do business much!
On offer are good juices, shakes, cold coffee in the drinks menu.
They have recently started keeping different and unique flavoured kulfis too!
One of my favorite orders here is the veg momo which is tasty. The chat items are good here too! Love the batata with soda!

Prices are decent. The sandwiches are well made too.

2481,"There was no option of Zero Rating so gave 1 star for misbehave and entry rejection to me.
As I wanted to be there during my Kolkata stay for couple of beers and ofcourse good music but they refused and said stag entry not permitted, later they allowed stag entry with charges to those who speak good Bengali. It was surprising.
Anyways , I always keep value and brand name respect but personally I don't endorse restaurants with biased behaviours to customer either on the basis of social status or basis of their language, color or apperance.
Anyways , It was a maiden experience of realising reality of racist and discriminating act in Eastern state of India known as West Bengal.",negative
8648,"Firstly the restaurant cannot seat 5 at a time,so that was a huge turnoff.
Secondly, the staff wasn't friendly and constantly took away out unfinished dishes as if there was a shortage of dishes.
Then we had ordered thumbs up and it reeked of alcohol. We asked them to change it but they refused saying it was from the dispenser. We tried to make them understand but to no avail.
We had ordered
Veg fried rice
Chicken fried rice
Chicken manchow soup
Chicken hot and sour soup
Mushroom masala
Pepper chicken
Schezwan chicken
The food wasn't worthy enough to be appreciated and the quantity of rice was not enough.

Never been that disappointed with a restaurant.
Not recommended at all.",negative

I find their snacks quite tasty and authentic in taste. Though having a typical bengali set of tastebuds ensure that I tend to lean more towards the traditional menu but their variety of non traditional role like mayonnaise etc are tasty.

1779,"Sorry Bohemian, the new look, updation and food menu is just not going with the current scene. I was an impeccable fan follower of your place but your recent menus (thrashing all the previous menus) made me very sad. Not that it makes me sad it makes me angry because very few of those items can suit up with tastebuds of Calcuttans. 
The variations (except some of the signature cocktails) are just lame and not upto the mark! We have ordered the Bhetki paturi variation and the Mangsho Haari. Both were ordinary but Mangsho was quite horrible. However, the Daab Sangria was refreshing!

Please change it soon!",negative

Thukpa, the yummilicious meal originates from Tibet and now is a popular dish of Nepal and Sikkim. It is a noodle soup , dashed in with scrumptious veggies which leaves a succulent, tangy aftertaste.
The place has colourful decor and courteous staff. But the food definitely stole the show .
It was my first time tasting thukpa and this warm main course delicacy will keep attracting me to this place.

Loved the dudhiya kabab and Mukund kabab. Loved the accompaniments. The paneer sabzi and Kali dal are prepared differently and are absolutely delicious. The highlight is the breads. All different types but so well made that you just want to keep eating. The only reason for the 4 rating is the biryani...it just wasn't good...and since its an Awadhi restaurant, it should have been excellent, but unfortunately it was a let down. So a must visit place, but biryani should be avoided.",positive

11221,"I am a patron of the Parsi cusine which happens to be very obscure in Calcutta. This is the only place in Calcutta that dishes up quintessential Parsi delicacies, considering the other caterer fails at maintaining authenticity & quality. I have been religiously having the Dhansaak for lunch on Sundays, since the last couple of years during my stay in Bombay and Poona. After moving back to Calcutta, this place manages to salvage me from withdrawal symptoms.

Their Mutton Dhansaak paired with Browned rice, topped with caramelised onions and the Lagan Nu Custard (a baked custard based dessert from the kitchens of Bawa Weddings), make for a sinful meal that's got me enslaved. Mrs. Meher Hansotia and her husband Dara Hansotia are always at their hospitality best. This makes for an unparalleled culinary experience inside an exquisite Parsi Dharamshala that's over a century old.

The glass ceiling in the lounge in my opinion is the USP of the place, and it ensures abundance of natural light as against the dimly lit places.

But with years passing by and with competition getting stiffer, it may have lost its edge a bit. However, the food is still better than average. I remember coming here quite a few years back and then now very recently the experience seemed not so bad either as far as food is concerned. We had the Kakori kebab and the Paneer Kali Mirch Tikka for starters. Both of them were average. The Masala Handi Mutton Biriyani was different. It was more Pulao than Biriyani, howvere it tasted pretty good. The place might seem a bit small and the service is a bit late than one would prefer.

I ordered a Mixed Gravy Noodles, along with a Schezwan Chicken!
Quantity of both the dishes were really good as per the pricing.
The mixed gravy noodles was full of chicken and prawn, and tasted high quality, i was amazed at the quantity and quality from such a shop. Next the Schezwan Chicken was full of flavours, and tickled my taste bud! Hats off to the chef, he must be a great one! Looking forward to other famous dishes of this joint, namely the dragon chicken.",positive

We quickly ordered for some starters that had beer battered tempura fish and Hong Shao Rou. The beer battered fish was exquisite! It was so tender and it tasted so well with the orange tartare ! The pork starter was tender and equally good!

For main course we had Lobster Thermidor which was a continental dish. The lobster was creamy and so damn delicious! We tried some Moon fan and chicken in oyster sauce next. Both the quantity and taste were impeccable!

As for drinks we ordered a virgin mojito, Chivas julep and the manager recommended a special bourbon cocktail for me which goes my the name Hitman! Hitman surely hit me with the taste and it'll would give you a good buzz with it's strong taste and flavor. Had a splendid time here and really enjoyed the food! Would visit this place again hopefully!",positive

They serve three bases-

1) Rice
2) Flat noodles
3) Hakka Noodles

After choosing the base, you get to choose Veg or Non-Veg. After that your preferred veggies, sauce and sprinkles. They will cook accordingly and your food will be ready!

▶️If you prefer sweet sauce then go for Spicy plum sauce and if you love spicy, then choose Volcano or Thai sauce. Kung Pao and Hunan sauces are moderately spicy.◀️

Also, I loved their Kiwi drink. It was my favourite drink of the day!

If you're planning to have custom made noodles or rice, then do visit this place and try their menu!",positive

Another big attraction of this restaurant is the mouth watering Tandoori Rolls for which one can quite often find a long queue at evenings.
Now coming to the foods,all the items come in good quantity and specially the tandoor dishes are exceptionally delicious.Their speciality is the Diana Kebabs,which not only taste good,but also is treat to the eyes.Yes,so colorful the burnt texture of the Chicken wings appear to be that no one can fail to notice that.
Inside the restaurant hardly a mass of 30 people can be accommodated,so it's better to take foods home.Prices are moderate enough.There is no parking space.

Bhavnagri Cheese poppers- This was really nice. The stuffing was cheesy with a little spice in it.
Chinatown Style Chilly Paneer- This was not that good in taste. It was simply Cottage cheese wrapped in some Sauce.
I wanted to try their pizzas which was not available.

Dal machaan and olive chilli Naan are my absolute favourite here, hands down to that.
Pocket pinch is okay too, I mean c’mon you get everything up to mark so you gotta pay too.

Coming to food. We ordered
1. Beer Batter Fish : This item I personally didn't like it. The item is over fried and that's why it losts it's taste.

2. Chicken cheese Lasagna: This item was amazing. Full of cheese and chicken served with Bread.

The Long island Ice tea was perfectly made.

Hookah was very smooth.

Overall the place is awesome. Staffs are really helpful and service is fast. Food quality needs some improvement.",positive

3490,"Being a resident of Airport Gate No 1 Area, I am one of the regular customer of this place. And most of the time, I loved it. But last day, the food was exceptionally brilliant.

I ordered Chicken Lollipop, Aalu Paratha, Lachcha Paratha, Daal Tadka and Butter Chicken.

Chicken Lollipop : Perfectly cooked chicken wings tossed in sauce mix. One of the best chicken lollipop among the delivery or take away joints of this area.

Lachcha Paratha : Not like those heavy - middle layer undercooked paratha like other places. This one was soft and can make a perfect duo with any side dish.

Butter Chicken : Your search for authentic Butter Chicken will stop here. Need to say more?

Rest of the items were okayish. Will love to order again.

Ordered the Filipino Style Fried Chicken Drums, accompanied with a lovely sweet and spicy chilli sauce.

The chicken drumsticks tasted fresh and appetising; the coating was crisp though a bit low in salt, which actually gave the chicken its authentic taste.
If one is fond of KFC then one would love gorging on the fried chicken drums from Funite, though the spicy zing of a KFC chicken leg is not guaranteed.

Overall they made for a nice wholesome evening snack for Panchami. Worth a try.",negative

It’s not just about the cuisines being served at these places but its also about how to present the food, the ambiance, the lighting, the mood that has been set and a host of other things. The quality of food has always been something that has been constant, but food has become a more integral part of hanging out and meeting people. So spaces or restaurants with places to hang out over good food and drinks are on top of everyone’s list and add live Television and big screens to that list and I am all jazzed up and good to go. Second House, Bar, and Restaurant is one such place with all the things that it has to offer.

The resraurant is on the way to Armhart Strert from College Street, just beside Surya Sen Street.. If you dont know the place, its hard to find.

Most interestingly, they have over 130 items in the menu. And as a food- adventurous person, every time I visit the place, want to try different items but each and every time got stuck to Chowmin and Chilli Pork..

Come to this place, enjoy the hospitality, enjoy the food and also enjoy a bit of North Calcutta culture...

The one star, I have not give, thats because of their very small capasity for sitting arrangements.. At most only 10 people can sit at once..

8292,So dissapointed with the puja buffet. Everything was so ordinary. Starting from kebabs to main course. Bangalir heshel was costly and did not live up to the hype. Sweets were ordinary. Peas pulao was stale. Mutton was ok. Dissapointed with the spread and service.,negative
7711,"An addition to the seafood scene in the city. Bay Bay's is a great option for coastal cuisine which is delicious and affordable!! The interiors are nicely done and the theme is marine, going with the name of the place. It's quite cost, with soft music playing. I had the following:-
Chicken Hot Wings - Very good!! Just the right amount of spicy.
Chicken Lasagne - Cheesy and creamy with a good amount of filling.
Mutton Uppu Curry with fried rice - Must try dish from here... Spicy rich mutton gravy with very soft and delicious mutton pieces 💗💗
Mango Pannacota - Quite good 👍
Ice cream sandwich- Ice cream between two big skices of brownie and slathered with chocolate sauce.
In a nutshell, Bay Bay's is doing white well for themselves. Cheers!!

Lacks a restroom which if you want to visit(Pay&Use) is behind Sonali Cinema which you can access via the alleyway beside the resto.Now coming to the food this place churns out some awesome food from their kitchen which definitely would satisfy your hunger prangs. Hospitality is good especially from the owner Sunny Sir,service may be bit slow especially during the time when a show breaks in the cinema above,at that time when you may find it to be bit crowded",positive

One of my friend wore flipflops..So they refused us rudely..They had no basic formality and courtsy..

Need highly modification on everything..",negative

We chose  fine dining experience with a la carte. We started with Mocktails like Moira street (fresh lime soda) and second one prepared from guava, chilli and spices and both were refreshingly cool. Then we had theirGondhoraj fried chicken - strips of chicken marinated with coriander and lemon and crispy fried. Then we had basmati rice, mug daal, aloo bhaja and dhokar dalna. The staffs were courteous and serving the food with a smile. Then we had bhetki paturi , chingri malai curry and mutton kasha with Bahari polao. Each of these were made to perfection. The bhetki was soft and juicy, the gravy of malai curry is so tasty and the mutton kasha is to die for. Then we had pineapple chutney and nolen gurer ice cream. This ice cream is must at the end.

I have visited the place mostly during the wee hours and have always been hosted with a smile and delicious biryani. I have tried both the mutton and chicken biryani. They usually serve big succulent pieces of mutton and once you become a known face, expect stellar service from the humble chachas. The biryani is best paired with the Mutton Kasha or Chicken Rezala. You may also try their Chicken Tandoori.",negative

6165,"Horrible will be an understatement. Had to throw away the food. It is too bad, not at all edible.
I ordered for crispy chili baby corn and drums of heaven.
Crispy chili baby corn could be taken only once, that too could not swallow the food. The corns are totally rotten and stale, the batter is made of besan, smell of oil is extremely strong. I don't know how could they sell such a food to customers. I had to actually throw away the whole dish.
Drums of heaven - a thick coating on chicken, Extremely spicy gravy, spicy as hell. Could not throw away so much of food, so has to forcefully eat it. Waste of 300 bucks straight away.
The first and last time I have ordered from this outlet. Please save your money, don't try to take this shit they serve.",negative

Very untidy and unhealthy atmosphere don’t go there. Drinking water is served in used glasses by previous customers coz I could see lipstick marks on glasses and even used straws in cold drinks. My goodness someone should close such a resturant immediately.,negative
6442,The ambience is to die for. They specialise in Biryani. But I felt I have tasted better of the same in Kolkata. The Chinese dishes are also good especially the crispy chicken...

Honestly, the food quality and quantity both were good, thou the chutney they serve was stale, as well as the soup. Chicken Bharta is a must try dish i would say. The authentic traditional punjabi ambience was quite attractive. Staff service was a bit slow, but they were polite to us. They need to work on few things. Other than that, it is truly one of the finest resturant in this zone. Looking forward to visit here again. 😊",positive

Their foods are mostly fresh but availability of items in the menu is a big question. I asked several questions about the menu only to hear Maximum to be unavailable.
The hot selling item,as usual with the other outlets is the Chicken Shawarma (both wrap and salad).
Mayonnaise here tasted a bit different,but the wrap was filling keeping the price in mind. Packing is a disaster here.",negative

1103,A place i love to visit. For the staff behaviour and food both. Molecular Gastronomy at it's best i must say. Do try there specials. The ambience will take u in the era of 80's bollywood.

Needless to say will come again and again😊,positive

3868,"It was a second time visit over here.
Its located in the basement of O2 hotel near airport.

Pros-
1. Got good ambience with minimum lights with a dance floor to groove on.
2. We ordered one U.S. french fries and an Indian Platter. Both food items were mouth watering.
3. Their LIT must be tried out if you are in The Drunken Monkey. LIT is lit AF 😁

Cons-
1. We also ordered a Hookah which had smoke missing. On complaining the server changed it, still it was as useless as previous one. Being a hookah addict it was a total turn off .
2. Service was on the slower side. Considering it was sunday eve and huge crowd, that can be ignored though.

We tried Burnt Chilly Prawn with Nagatok Seafood Topping Noodles. It was a wonderful experience and I should recommend others to try out also. Lastly a famous dessert The Tilhou Kheer was a delightful experience.

The AC had water leaks, when we complained they told us to ""shift your chair"". It was suffocating, and we were dying to get out.
2. Food: you could not see the fried chicken with microscope even if you wanted to. The hookah was not enjoyable die to the crowd.

And I have fallen in love with them!!
The food quality is really good!
The packaging is bang on!
So I ordered their noodles bowl,rice bowl and chicken drumsticks.
The noodles and rice bowl came with 4pieces of chilli chicken.And the rice and noodles had ample amount of chicken and eggs in them.They tasted super delicious and fresh.
The drumsticks however were wings actually.But tasted decent.
Will be ordering soon!

8251,"Usually i do not rate an outlet too bad, but this deserves a mention. Very ordinary approach. Very basic amenities. Small place, not saying cozy. Ordered a chicken sandwich. Initially I thought looking at the packing, it's coming straight out of a mio amore store but they taste better. It was very salty, some lays cream and onion chips and kissan ketchup sachet. It ends with a louse hand written paper bill. Wow. Completely avoidable",negative
4026,"I don't think that I should need to mention where it is located 😂😂. Anyway it's located in new market area at the first floor of the KFC, WOW MOMO building which is knows as NEW EMPIRE MOVIE HALL.

I have visited here many times but this time I went there after a longtime and it's totally different. Renovated the entire new empire. Now it's become awesome. Staffs were as usual very polite.

Best place to hang out with your friends or perfect place to make a reunion here. Environment was good and the price of the foods and drinks are moderate. Quantity and quality of the food was increased by earlier.",positive
3753,"A very recently opened outlet at Baranagar.... It's a value for money joint for foodies ... For me it's a great place at my reach with wide varieties of dishes....

Had ordered one Cantonese Chicken but it turned out to be out of stock... But the owner revert back and asked me to order a substitute dish... He was generous and polite.. I ordered a kung pao chicken and the delivery was prompt and was on time....

The taste was really good... And at this price range this is one of the best addition to the collection of restaurant at Baranagar area... I would recommend everybody to try this out... It's really good..",positive

3562,"Located within a very short distance from my home, this cafe with its fabulous array of mouthwatering delicacies and an awesome decor has the potential to rewrite the 'eating out' aspect in this part of Kolkata. The Palbazar - Jheel Road junction off Sukanto Setu has been since ages been the favourite for Rolls, Fries and at the most Biriyani. There were no options of sipping into a coffee in a quiet place and munch on varied delicacies. So, this culinary destination must come out of its comfort zone of just serving loyalists and reach out to the Gen Y and coffee recluses like myself in this locality. 
My favourites of Cafe Art Street are Hot Chocolate, gorgeous french fish & chips, yummy brownies and Chicken Bruschetta....",positive

8911,"Located right opposite to Allen Park,this is one of the most visited place for reasonable and hygienic food by office goers and students. I've been visiting this place since 2015. First it was known as 'Maggie Point' now they have renamed it as Yippee Point. The food quantity and quality is perfect according to the price. They have a variety of items one could have in a given lunch break. It is usually crowded. The staffs are quite friendly and quick in making the food. I feel their best items are cheese vegetable wai wai, corn sandwiches and momos. Their Khichdi is also amazing. One should try it if they want to have something that reminds them of home.",positive
925,"Had heard pretty good reviews about this place.. uber eats had special offers going on so ordered from this place and was not disappointed at all. The food was super tasty. What was more impressive was their packaging. The boxes were tightly sealed and there was no spillage of any sorts, they even sent the cutleries in clean sealed packets..

Personally I loved this place,went there on Friendship day,2017 with two of my friends and we had a really good time there..
A beautifully arranged bookshelf is there to welcome you warmly..the place is not too big but it is cute..

553,"It's a newly opened cafe near Lord's crossing. Easy to locate as it is located in the lane just beside Bandhan Bank.

The ambience is cosy and the staffs are courteous and helpful also well mannered. Also it provides an outdoor seating facility which is good.

Food was good and the portions were quite enough for two medium eaters.

We had
● Fish Fingers for starters. 6 pieces are served. Taste was good.
● Schezwan fried rice , again as I've mentioned that the quantity is well enough for two medium eaters.
● Sweet and Sour chicken to accompany with fried rice. 8 pieces are served. Well prepared and perfect balance of spices.

Only request is that the chefs should be a bit more careful while preparing the food as I've found a small hair in the chicken. But the owner apologised for it.

But yes otherwise this is good. Try it out surely you won't regret . Also would like to mention that no GST is charged.",positive
4125,"Just gave this restaurant cause I saw many young hard working boys taking lot of effort in the food making process.
The food is good in taste.
What is special is the large amount of chicken that they give.

Team up with chilli chicken and chicken manchurian is good.
Price is also low.",negative

The restaurant owner instead of refunding tells me that it would get adjusted in my next bill. Like how can they be so sure that we are going to ever order pizza from this place!! Thanks to #zomato for refunding us the money. Coming to the pizza - cheap quality pizza with very less toppings and cheese. This is the type of pizza which you get from local confectionery even worse. Sorry to say guys but just naming a shop pizzeria house doesn't work, you have to earn the name. My rating would be 1.5 but as there are no option to give that I am giving 2.",negative

Combos are filled with veg fried rice+ chicken wings+ chili chicken+ salad+ice-cream.

Rice was quite good but really disappointed their chicken wings. After I tasted I think that they want to made their chicken wings recipie just like ""KFC style crispy chicken wings"" but,they failed & chili chicken was okayish.
They served vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce on topping.

Total bill- 220/- (including tax)",negative
4148,"Went here today and ordered one pasta alfredo (chicken) and one pasta arrabbiata (chicken). Arrabbiata tasted tangy and saucy and quite to our liking. Alfredo was creamy and cheesy and very light and we loved it! Reasonable pricing.

2. Vegetables are way too spicy.
Please look after the hygiene, since it is a roadside shop.
Overall it is worth trying and they deliver real quick.",positive

We ordered chinese soups and chinese non veg starters which were quite decent. For mains we ordered chicken biriyani and chicken tikka masala. Both the dishes had no salt in them so we needed to add extra salt. Overall a decent place to visit.",positive

742,"My big fat belly is undoubtedly is one of the best restaurant Kolkata has to offer. Burgers like you haven't had before with very few competitors in the city. It not just excels in the burger department but also pasta and other goodness.
Grilled chicken burger was juicy and sumptuous, tingling taste buds while pasta itself was one of the best I've had the privilege to have. BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE was OUF OF THE WORLD. To me Rouge serves the best but this comes so close to it. I'd drop by just to have its cheesecake. Blueberry shake could've been better considering the high standard it set with its food.
Absolutely must go.",positive
6441,"The food I like here are the Momos, Crispy Chicken and Pan Fried Chicken. The portions are quite good and delicious. I don't like the main courses much and the prices are a little on the steeper side. The ambience is very good but the service needs to improve a lot!",negative
1507,"This is a small yet well decorated place which boasts of very light but delicious biryani. I had ordered the chicken biryani and chicken pasanda platter while Debabrata Ghora opted for chicken chaap and tandoori roti. Each item was good in taste, except for the chicken chaap which was a bit stiff.
The place is pocket friendly. The staff is courteous. The service is a bit slow.
Above all, a good place to satisfy your hunger pangs.",positive
3775,"Visited this place yesterday on Saptami evening. The rooftop location is definitely a plus.
Since we were not in the mood for something heavy, so we decided to go for the starters. We had Tandoori aloo, fish tikka and aloo chaat. All of them were good and went down really well with the drinks - specially the aloo chaat, with its right amount of spicy and tangy mix.
Coming to the drinks, they had a good spread - though a tad bit overpriced.
However, the best part was the sheesha. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have the option of the bigger sheesha's as well. Coming from Kuwait, where the bigger sheesha's are the norm, this was a welcome change from the miniature sheesha's you get in most places in Kolkata.
Overall a good experience and definitely holds repeat value.",positive
2822,"When you see those pictures and think that what you have ordered is something like but when you eat it is not exactly the same. Same thing happened between me and A-1 Taj Biryani. The quantity was moderate I have already visited many biryani house near Baghajatin, Selimpur and Dhakuria but out of all I found this one where the quantity is bit less. The quality is also not the great I could say that many biryani house provide better quality than this. Otherwise it is kind of moderate that's why I gave it 3 stars. #Moderate #TasteLess #Oily",negative
10777,"Beautifully decorated, yet small. We really had to wait for a long time before the food was served to us. Bacon didn’t taste something out of the extraordinary, the wrap was better than the meat. Thai noodles tried from the main course is a must. And it’s spicy. Griled chicken wings were okayish, served with french fries.
The price is comparatively cheaper with the food that they serve. Didn’t get the chance to order dessert so can’t comment on that. Moreover can be visited for the second time. A three star is what I wish to give them considering everything the food, ambience and the staffs.",negative
10791,"Located on a very busy point of new market area, a hard to miss place( but it won't matter much even if you do miss it). Ordered chicken biryani which was decided after taking a minute or two which, in turn, seemed to work on the waiter's nerves(a good loo k was received by my friend). The biryani was placed in front of us and the guy marched back to his post like an obedient soldier(not hearing for once what we were ordering next). For the food part, biryani was ok. A ghee ka tadka saved the grace somehow( it was not dry atleast)
Ambience in old restaurants is not a point to mention so overall, the crowd did tell that the place is famous, maybe next time if we order with a military precision, we might get a better service.",negative

Earlier this place was pretty big with seating accomodation for about 20 people, it was also air conditioned. Coming to the food , the burgers and the subs were very good. But one thing, they didn't have any quality management, meaning, one day it happened that I had burger there with a few of my friends, and later that day, I took a burger as takeaway. The takeaway burger was horrible. Now the shop has become very small, doesn't have air conditioning any more, has very less seating space and is no more suitable for hanging out with friends. Last I went there , burgers were not even available. The place has highly degraded.",negative

Apparently pretty popular especially among the college lads in and around this area, these guys dish out some of the amazing tea. For snacks, one can have Samosas and Jalebis. The food and tea are made fresh, and owing to high demand, you get fresh offerings.

10239,"Despite being brought up by seeing this old man I never visited here before. After 15 years, at last, I made a visit to this restaurant.
Famous for its moglai which is popularly called as 'Anadir moglai' is delicious, though the sabji which is served with this is not up to the mark. I also have ordered one mutton kosha which is quite tasty and savoury.
Staffs are genial and quick. Overall, it is a good place to fill your tummy when you are hungry.",positive
11206,"This is a small place near Rathtala, Belgharia, with excellent tasty dishes.

I generally get our dinner delivered to my house on most nights from Bangaliaana and there has been not a single day when they disappointed me.

I do not recommend dining out in case of this eatery. But if you plan on getting it delivered to your house, then let me tell you, they offer really quick and prompt services. You'll receive hot, fresh, and delicious food in no time.

Though the restaurant offers both Indian (specifically bengali cuisine) and Chinese cuisines, I prefer the former to the latter. And I would recommend the same.
....................................................................................
What I love the most:

Chicken Bharta, Masala Kulcha, Aloo Parantha, Chicken Kosha, Chicken do piyaazi, Chicken Masala, Paneer Butter Masala, Chicken Manchurian and Veg Manchurian. Even the mutton is lovely.

Highly recommended.",positive

8056,"Located near milan bazar kestopur. This outlet Surprisingly very cheap and provides amazing dessert and snacks. I tasted their mango shake, strawberry shake and the cold coffee. I have to say the shakes taste like high standard restaurants. They are all @59 and cold coffee is @69. Roadside seating arrangement, no fan but it's not a big deal to adjust. But they servers the order very quickly. Must try their shakes",positive

4890,"A decent place to soothe your shwarma cravings.
The food is mostly fresh and chicken tender.
Don't go for the mutton variants though.

Falafels and chiken shwarma are my favourite. Especially like their mint mustard chutney combo (a side with the wraps). The sauce to filling ratio is good with bits of veggies tossed in. Humus/mayo isn't overly sweet. 

They don't have a lot of competition still doing well.
Seating is crunched and non existent almost.
However for a quick grab, it's pretty good.
Pricing is non objectionable.
Packaging may disappoint you, so spot eating is most recommended.",negative
4114,"I ordered a combo of chicken biryani and mutton chaap and cold drinks. There was no chicken in biriyani and instead of mutton chaap they gave chicken chaap. Was too hungry when the order came so didn't call for a complaint. Anyway this is how this place tricks people?
People please don't order from this place or got to this place.
And also the quality of the food is questionable. Poor quality rice and there was no proper biriyani smell or taste.",negative

Tikiya wasn't much oily compared to other similar cheap priced restaurants. Taste wise it was okey. Paratha was thin, small and became hard in transport. Packaging was basic. But food is very cheaply priced here.

Can't really complain about anything at this price point. Thanks Pappu Da for the dinner.",negative

7412,"A very short visit before catching up a movie on 15th August because this was the only place where there was no queue.They have different sections for Bar and Restaurant. We ordered Biryani and a Chicken dish because we had exact 30 minutes to explore and they served perfectly. Aroma of biryani was little bit on higher side otherwise it was tasty.I shall review in detail once I get back to there again,I will :)",negative
7432,"Its a very tiny place, and they have tried to make the most of such a tiny place by dividing it into 3 sections, nicely designed, but the top section is a bit congested especially for the taller people, also it doesn't get the proper cooling from their AC, because of which they have a table fan above, which is quite funny in a cafe.

Now coming back to their food, I feel their menu is contradictory in nature with their name (PP's vegan). I mean we literally thought that they are gonna serve only the vegan food items going by their name, but the menu is not vegan, its vegetarian. Until and unless they mean something else by the word vegan (which only they can explain). 

Now coming back to the order we placed. We ordered one (nachos+pasta+soft drink) from their combo special, and we really liked the pasta (mix sauce)

Verdict: Will I visit here again? May be, I don't know.",negative
3234,"Suggested by a friend, went to second house for dinner. It was a great place for hangout with your friends. It has everything that is required for a great evening with friends.
Loud sound , dim lights , and pocket freindly alcohols. Seating capacity is less so avoid peak hours. Great ambience with friendly staffs. Mostly the crowd was of young bunch of people . Will suggest not to go with family here mainly at evening because they might not like loud sound.

Now coming to the food
As it was friday they offer 2:1 on every alcohol. We ordered
1.mushroom cabana - 3/5
2. Churmur chat - 2.5/5
3. Peanut masala -3/5
4. Chicken salad - 3.5/5

Not ordered any main dish as we were full by having beers and starters.
So on food side it was ok. It may improve. But other things are great.

Pocket puinch was 1200 for two including taxes.

Could not click any pics due to low light.

Final verdict - best place to booze with your friends with very less pinch on pocket.",positive

2687,"5 steps from Satgachi more, and you get this highly recommended restaurant.📍

We ordered:

🍜🍗🍗HongKong Chicken Momo- It's actually a plate of huge stuffed dumplings for 2. It's ridiculous if a single person wraps it entirely. 8 large pieces nicely served with hot sauce and soup. It was quite amazing.

🌶🍅🌰 Veg Hot & Sour Soup - Was definitely a god choice, but certainly a bit spicy with too much of chillies, making it resistable after sometime. Could have been better.

🍝🍛🌶 Mixed Gravy Noodles- Good to eat when you're too hungry like I was. Fine mixture of everything with thick gravy.

🍗🍗🌶Chili Chicken- As usual, it was good enough to finish it in one go. Moderately spicy and nice taste.😊

Pocket Pinch 💳: it's really reasonable. 920( AI)

Definitely worth Trying when you're nearby Nagerbazar.

Worth Recommending.👍",positive

9341,"Worst fast food stall ever. Ordered a double egg double mutton roll, told mutton roll not available. So went with the double egg double chicken roll for takeaway. Waited for 10mins after that my roll was ready. It did not have double chicken and the roll was full of dalda and the sauce was scattered all over the roll which made it very disgusting to taste. Also the chicken chunks were chewy and not tender. I will never ever visit this place again in my life. The chicken roll costed me whopping 48/- bucks. There are much better options for rolls in behala like arsalaan, panna's kitchen, haji saheb etc but definitely not this one. I am attaching the pic of the chicken roll. Look how disgustingly they served the roll.",negative
304,"They usually give raining discounts, so I decided to order a plate of Chicken Biriyani one day. I would say it was good, the quantity the piece of chicken. The flavour was a bit different, a bit like home made, and not those typical handi biriyanis served in every corner of Kolkata. It was full of flavour. Would like to order some kebabs and chicken dishes from this place the next time.",negative
3081,"During the Pujas, the best way to avoid the crowd and eat comfortably is to visit Park Street. This small restaurant situated amongst giants, is almost un-noticeable. But it does make a huge statement with its quality food. 

I ordered Chicken Drumsticks, Chicken Egg Hakka chowmein and Chilli Garlic Chicken. Although we were pretty late to arrive at the restaurant, yet they managed to serve us fresh and really tasty food. The chicken drumsticks had 8 pieces but fried well. Their home made hot sauce needs a mention here. 
The Chowmein had good quantity of both chicken and egg, and the chicken pieces in the Chilli Garlic Chicken were soft and succulent from the inside.  
I left this place craving for more. Besides being really tasty, this place us really light on the pocket. Do visit this place and let me know what to try the next time i visit!",positive

For desserts we had the mudcake with caramelized bananas and ice cream. My personal favorite and ending the meal on a sweet note, was the chocolate paan. This place is surely recommended!

Loved the butterscotch milkshake and mixed food juice .The dessert section was good.Planning to reserve a tabke again for dinner soon.",positive
7331,"After a long gap I ordered mutton biryani from Rahmania, Mullick Bazar. It took a long time to receive my order. First of all the biryani came in a paper box. The box contains a piece of mutton, a potato and flavourful rice. Rice is very rich and full of spicy cloves. You can fell the spiciness of cloves throughout the biryani rice. Really loved it. The medium size mutton piece was soft, tender and perfectly cooked. Long gain of basamati rice was very much satisfactory. But the negative part was poor packaging in paper box and excessive use of Dalda. As I received my order late, dalda started to thicken the rice n eventually it lead the biriyani little soggy. This kind of biryani may cause indigestion and felt heavily overburdened. 
Date :- 15-Nov-2018 (Thursday)",negative
2550,We checked into our hotel and thought of stepping out for lunch. After checking nearby I came across this place a short walk and there we were. I was surprised at the entrance itself very well done up. The restaurant was empty for a weekday but I must say the ambience was refreshingly different. Cooking to the food we orders dim sums which was really good to my surprise a plate of pho and Thai green curry. The food is excellent and tasty. The pho was fresh and just the way I like it. I need to mention the staff here are very courteous friendly and go out of the way to accommodate you. A must visit if you are in the area and a welcome change from all the local so called Chinese restaurants around.,positive
8909,"I was craving Illish to go with my home cooked rice (Just middle class things) and decided to order for their 'Bhapa'. I was initially sceptical due to the low price of the dish when compared to the other restaurants but decided to give it a try. However, all reservations proved unnecessary because there were 2 pieces of perfectly looking fresh fish in a beautifull yellow gravy. It was just like home cooked food and I was delighted. The fact that Bengali food has delicate flavours and doesn't need to be dripping in oil is a fact forgotten by most Bengali restaurants. The prices too don't look to far fetched.
I didn't take a photo but look forward to ordering again.",positive

•chicken biriyani(3.5/5)- a full plate of biriyani is enough for one.. Enough quantity of rice, one potato and big size of soft, well cooked chicken served along with raita.. tasted good enough..

Chicken Ala Kiev- it's basically like chicken stuffed with humongous amount of butter. As you try to have your first bite it just oozes out. And its serve with smashed potatoes and peas.
Chicken Ala Olypub- it's chicken fry served with deep fried bread pieces. And topped with a creamy sauce which just makes the chicken taste heavenly.

The Mr.Burger fried chicken and egg burger was a gem..perfectly fried chicken with suuny side up between two buns..exotic..
The oreo shake was refreshing.
The price was a tad bit high..but worth every penny..",positive

4038,"If you are a Kolkatan with a love for food & a good chat & old school ambience, you probably try this place once!while many of the eateries haven’t been able to survive the test of time & have given in drop of quality & hike in prices, this place still is managing the service with the reasonable rate!
The food was quite great specially the chicken pahari as starter which was suggested by the floor manager, an elderly person with a great hospitality.The chello kebab was Amazing and freshly done.The Barbecue chicken sizzler managed to get a nod from my fussy eater husband which probably tells how good it is!
The thing to notice is the amount of attention the patrons are given & the congenial atmosphere!
Visiting shortly again!!
ThumbsUp!",positive

It's a newly opened shop near RDB cinema hall, Sector V.

And guess what guys, it's totally veg. A good news for veg guysssss. 🔔
Many varieties of rolls are available here even pizza rolls.
And it has minimum amount of oil that you can't actually feel even. Even you get sweet rolls there. Isn't it amazing? 😍
And you can even choose your own flour of roll 😱. Want little extra? Add ones are also there.

It's a must go shop for all of you, just try it.",positive

We ordered their English breakfast that came with choice of a beverage, eggs, sausages, grilled tomato, toast and preserves. Second dish on the menu that we ordered was Indian chicken sandwich (this was heavenly) came with homemade sauce and salad. Thora dish on our table was Belgian waffle with whipped cream, strawberry jam and maple syrup. The food was delicious but the only deterrent is the service which is excruciatingly slow.

The Pork ribs were amazeeeee balls , super juicy, coated with really good quality brown sauce ! Best I ever had(not exaggerating) Chicken Penne Pasta was creamy and the sauce wasn't overdone , with a good amount of meat !
You may think i won't write about the Coke but i will cause that impressed me too. Don't know about you but most of the time when I order Coke in restaurants (like Subway, KFC etc) it doesn't have a good amount of fizz (almost nil) even after you complain and get a second cup. This place won't let you down like that !

Service was also really good , and they also click a photo of you and give you a hard copy of it you can keep , which i have not seen in any other place : quite interesting !

1029,"It was a Christmas lunch and we had many options. Among them we chose afraa as we saw turkey and many other gorgeous names in their buffet menu online. But got a big time disappointment with the taste of the foods.
Firstly the starters served in the table was cold. They had no menu in the table so we had to ask them for options if available or not. Beer options were very limited.
Coming to the main course only one type of rice was there. The salads were mixed up and same with the desserts also. The turkey seemed to be undercooked. The only savior was pabrai's ice-cream.
Their new renovated ambience was good though.
The food made no justice to the value we paid and it also doesn't go with the brand name afraa.",negative

They also provide complimentary oregano seasonings, chilli flakes as well as mayonnaise dip. Packing is fine and prices are very high!

183,"Well this may be a famous place with a long history of providing good food to the people visiting park street, however in my opinion it is lacking the basic qualities that determine a good restaurant from a bad one. Firstly they are having a lengthy waiting time. I mean we ordered one sandwich and one burger and had to wait for 30 minutes for the same to arrive on our table. I mean it is christmas time so one should have sufficient staff available to shorten the waitng time.2ndly they dont take care of your order. We had placed order for a cappuccino but we never got it. Thirdly one has to decide what one has to order from outside the restaurant. This is totally not done for a place like flurys. They should definitely look into the matter in order to not lose their customer base.",negative

3. Tori (Chicken) Teriyaki - delicious. Must try!
4. Chicken Miso Ramen - nice and warm. Tasted average!
5. Tori Yakimeshi (fried rice) - absolutely delicious!

Indian dishes here, won't disappoint you any way.
The biriyani you get here is good at the price.

One of the best carbonara I have ever had, loaded with abundant quantity of bacon. The pancakes were the cutest and the fluffiest.

7778,"Machhli Baba started with the fresh fish business and now have expanded into serving delicacies on your platter. Machhli Baba Fries is what they have christened this venture and have built up quite a reputation for themselves in this short space of time. No doubting the quality of food served, but they will be better off increasing the size of the portions. The fish items are class, but the other ones (read: chicken), though not bad, fail to match their fish counterparts. So, there is a scope of improvement in that department. The Dimer Devil is another item to savour. Food is prepared in utmost hygienic conditions too and that is a huge positive. The mustard sauce (Kashundi) that they provide along with the savouries has quite a knock out punch....by far the best and that too by quite some distance.
All in all a good place to order from and they can only get better.",positive

I ordered one special mutton biriyani. The quantity was huge with two pieces of mutton, one egg and one potato.

I gave a try to two of their exotic fries, namely Tandoori Chilli Fries and Poppers & fries. The former one tasted better along with the flavour of tandoori sauce mixed with chilli garlic. The latter did had a good amount of veg poppers topped with a lots of mayo but the fries itself tasted a bit bland. Quantity of the fries are decent and the price is kept very reasonable.

This can be your ultimate destination if you are looking around for some snacks to munch upon around Bhawanipur. Being the only fries shop serving 100% veg fries, it can an ideal destination for vegetarians.",positive

778,"This place is located on the 5th floor in A block of the Pantaloons complex in Camac street. The overall ambience is good and food is average. Most probably they have happy hours on drinks before 7pm on weekends. The thing they need to work on is there DJ. The DJ was repeating the same songs back to back which was very irritating. Service is good but one thing really sucks that is you can't leave your table empty even if you are dancing. They will allot your table to someone else and tell you to clear the bill if your table is empty and you are on the dance floor. This rule or thing is really not good. If your cafe has dancing floor then this policy should not be followed. Due to this reason my rating has fallen from 3 to 2 for this place.

5952,"The biryani arrived in about half hour.It was hot.
The biryani was okay and not very good.
The reason for this is you get a synthetic biryani flavour that comes from using readymade biryani masala and not authentic spices.

When you are having biryani from a restaurant you do not expect to be served biryani made with readymade masala.Making biryani is complex and once my mom cooked biryani with readymade masala that had an outcome just like the biryani from this place.

Coming to potato piece and chicken,I got an extremely small potato piece but the rest of the packets had decent sized pieces.The chicken pieces were breast meat and largish in size.They were not very tender and not very tough too.The meat was flavourless.

I got the biryani at 70rs and the price is justified at this price point.
I wont be very keen to order from this place again due to them using readymade masala for biryani.",negative

- Cold Choco Latte
- Fire and Ice
- Paneer Croquettes
- Cannelloni Florentine
- Apple Pie
- Chocolate Mousse

Both the shakes were excellent, it was perfectly made. Fire and Ice was a spicy mocktail, it was something innovative which would be loved by the people who likes spicy and tangy food.

Coming to the Food, i found both the dishes to be a bit bland for my tastebuds. It should have been a bit spicy and more flavorful.

Apple pie was served with a scoop of ice cream and it tasted good. While Chocolate mousse tasted just ok.",negative

The Chicken Pakoras were crunchy with a meaty filling. It was pretty good compared to the ones available in most outlets at similar price points. A worthy try.
Lastly a bodylicious and strong coffee to end the evening.
Of course, the Adda among the group of four of us was an added bonanza over everything.

Food here was not very good. Potato fries was the only thing i liked in both the sizzler. Corns were not tasty. A taste of tomato ketchup was coming from oriental sizzler.
They can improve their food and the services.",negative

**1. Chicken Nuggets - Nothing unusual. It's just paying extra money for something you have for evening snacks.. 😂😂😂😂
2. Chicken Spring Roll: It was really good. It was crunchier outside and juicy inside. A perfect blend of flavours and a balance of spices. It's obviously a much recommended dish..
3. Chicken Pizza: It was good. It might not give a pizza hut or dominos pizza feeling but it was good enough. The pizza had olives, chicken and Bell peppers as toppings. The bread as soft but it would have been better if it was baked properly. Overall.. You can give it a try
The ambience was moderate but the food was good. The prices were reasonable and it's a good place for friends to hang out!! 😀😀😀**

This place, located right near the St. Xaviers college is a paradise for the vegetarian lovers. It has quite an ongoing ambience along with the staffs who were more than just polite. They have probably recruited the best staffs i have visited so far.

Coming to the food, we had ordered one punjabi thali that consisted of 2 soft and fluffy naan pcs, 1 pcs laccha paratha, 1 choice of daal, 2 sorts of veggie assortation, 1 choice of sweet(the best one), achaar, papad, 1 type of rice and 1 choice of raita.

The Hakka noodles looked ok nothing great .....the Manchurian was spicy,negative

4734,"One word. Bad. The cheese momos were an absolute disaster. They spread the cheese ( or was it cheap mayo?) over the momos, which did not blend with the stuffing inside. The shawarma salad was very average and it does not come with pita bread. Again, more mayo and veggies than chicken (perhaps not more than 20gms of chicken). The shawarma honey mayo burger was without honey and overload of mayo. In short, they should rename their joint ""Mayo king"".

Not an experience I'm willing to repeat anytime soon. The chicken bharta was way too bland for my taste, don't know why it came up in the recommended dishes.

This has always been a common problem for most mediocre eating joints. Whether it is a chicken item or a mutton or a fish item, there is just one omnipresent gravy. Everything goes in there and gets served in separate bowls! That's the only difference.....

it's a small para shop which is supposed to be friendly but has a snobbish man sitting on the counter.
they have only 1 table somehow crammed into their room with 4 chairs.
I ordered dhoka, jalebi and tea. all of them were okay. jalebi tastes decent. the tamarind chutney they serve with dhokla is extremely sweet, it ruins the overall taste,they don't give any green chutney, or green chilly with dhokla.
I believe this place is better for delivery and it's worthless to visit to dine in.
I was given the bill after requesting for it.
also they won't serve anything in a single piece, you will have to buy samosas or dhokla or anything in a pair.
I won't recommend this place for dine in or walk in.
perhaps for delivery via trusted partners the food should be okay.",negative

We called for a hookah, and again waited for someone to come take an order for a very long time. The hookah which came in was decent. The cottage cheese croquettes tasted fine, our next dish took almost an hour to come which was a eggplant baked dish. It came to us cold and it did not even taste great either.

First up their service is something to talk about, the ambience is pretty good too and the food definitely did so well.
Orderd mysore masala dosa for myself with 3 other chutneys among many they have option for which is of no extra cost.
Right from the first bite I got extremely excited from what will come next with so many chutneys to mix and match.
The dosa was soft and crisp at the right places, with mysore masala spicy as it gets. It had tastes of multiple levels thanks to its chutneys.

Ambience: classy interiors with well spread regal couches and a bar at the corner. Positive is that it is not dimly lit like the normal pub culture.
Food: First downer no cocktails available as per menu here. In house menu is different. Hence settled for regular beer and a virgin mojito with tacos and finally a shrimp although they had prawns as mentioned pasta in red sauce. The tacos were 4 in number, served with tomato relish, at the price, at least 6 were expected. The pasta was pretty and of moderate taste with nothing special.
Zomato gold redeemed without problem.

10561,"We all love having fast foods and in today's world it is like we eat almost every single day. 
Located near Dhakuria Rath Bari or rather say Bus Stand in Dhakuria it is a small shop. Mostly it is a take away corner with lots of different items in their list. Being a local guy I often visit to this shop and the quality is good. Really can't expect better quality at that cheap price. The problem is Quantity which is not at all satisfying, for a foodie like me we need bit more to eat that what they serve. The other problem is as the shop is situated on the side of the road and it is mostly take away so the only place to stand is to on the footpath which gives rise to problems for the pedestrians. 
I have ate Egg Tarka, Panner Tarka, Egg Roll, Chicken Roll, Chili Chicken(too spicy), Egg Chow, Chicken chow and many other items.",negative
7006,"First thing, consider the rating of 3 as 3.5, as the Zomato app doesn't allow .5 anymore...
The service was good, staff were helpful although the service was on the slower side but still not a major inconvenience.
Coming to the location, located right beside acropolis mall (which is gaining its own footfall every season) the restaurant has a potential to gain more popularity.
Some food items are slightly overpriced, atish-e- aloo was good but again not worth the price they are charging. According to me the price correction is required, atleast at this stage.",negative
6811,"I ordered Chicken Steamed Momo and Chicken Fried Momo from this place. They make some awesome Momo's. I don't know why they are not so famous as some of the other Chinese restaurants for their Momo's. You definitely must try their Momo's. The only let down was the sauce. The Sesame Chilly sauce which they provided with the Momo felt like it was devoid of salt and thus didn't taste good. I thought that maybe they forgot to put salt on that particular day. So, few days later I ordered the same and again the sauce was devoid of salt. So, I think that there definitely is a room from improvement in there. But definitely their Momo's are worth it. Juicy, Succulent pieces of keema chicken in the momos..",positive
8923,"A newly opened cafe in Ajaynagar. We ordered Oreo shake, white sauce chicken pasta and chicken cheese balls. I was really impressed by the food. The pasta was sufficient for 2 people and was filling. They gave lots of bell peppers and broccoli and chicken. The sauce was tasty. The chicken cheese balls were 8 piece at 120 rupees and we could feel the cheese melting in our mouth! The Oreo shake was perfect.. It was not too sweet nor too bland. They even gave vanilla ice cream at the top with lots of Oreo and chocolate sauce.

The prices are reasonable and the quantity is worth the price. It's easily affordable for students. The interior is pretty and the seating arrangement is good. The staff was warm and welcoming.

I would definitely recommend this to everyone and those who live in this area. It was a sudden discovery and turned out to be pretty good!! More than what we expected!",positive

The ambience is average at best and seeing the outside decor, you might have second thoughts before entering here but the trust me the food is great. They have rolls at the ground floor and the air-conditioned restaurant is on the second floor. The food I found to be very good and it's pocket-friendly as well. The garlic paneer stood out among the dishes and I have to say it's one the best sweet garlic dish I have ever had. Would definitely recommend trying out this place.",positive

Now coming to the ambience I must say that It's really good. Though you'll not get air conditioned area in the ground floor but you'll get it in the first floor. The restaurant is neat and clean. The staffs were really good.

Now coming to the food. I ordered tandoori ruti and one chicken tikka masala(suggested by a staff). It was really sumptuous and finger licking as well as spicy. There were six chicken pieces in the thick gravy.

It was a great day. This restaurant has won my heart. To speak the truth I'm going to visit this restaurant many more times.",positive

A new outlet in the very heart of Gariahat, this one is a delightful surprise. Nice, clean and good ambience - what more do you want from an eatery?
I ordered the pizzeria pasta and I must say that it is one of the better pastas I have had in the city. You can clearly taste the pizza type tangy tomato flavour in a slightly creamy sauce. Topped with olives and cheese, this is one dish worth trying. Although I could eat only one dish here, I think I will frequent here to try their varied menu.",positive

Alu Paratha was delicious to taste, the filling was evenly spread and with the right kind of spice blend.The taste of Tharka was nothing to rave about, though not a spoiler.The Lassi came in a disposable glass with a dome lid on top.It was not the thickest blend of curd I had ever tasted .I had opted for the sweet Lassi and it was just accurately sweetened.
There is also a plain Paratha combo with the same combinations, and it was equally tasty, and the parathas were soft rightly griddled and thoroughly enjoyable",positive

Common you can recommend somebody after they sit not before even they tell you how many heads. When we asked for a finger bowl at the end the staff Kamalika was ride and just gave one.

Right from the time that you enter this place you will notice the narrow marble staircase reminiscent of old kolkata houses. The interior is devoid of glitsy decor; there is a space where couples can dine in an enclosed balcony kind of space.
Although the interiors are simple, the food at this place more than makes up for it, both in terms of quality and decent quantity. I have dined at this place quite a few times earlier too and it was good. Chinese cuisine, north indian along with their dessert and mocktails are worth having. Some of the stuff that I have previously had and liked were fish fry, tandoori chicken, rice noodles, garlic naan, mutton kosha etc to name a few.
This place is worth going to when you are in and around gariahat and want to quickly satisfy you hunger pangs with some tasty food.",positive

The French fries lost their crispiness,but that's acceptable. The fried chicken was super tasty. The burgers were also good for the price actually. They were a little chewy,a bit more mayonnaise would make the burgers👌.Real value for money according to me and I'll definitely order more!

I chose not to argue but to move ahead and have the food rather wasting my time and mood.
While we tasted the food it was more pathetic with small lumps of black burnt vegetables inside.

Delivery was pretty smooth – bang on time, also the packing deserves an applaud – a nice pretty air tight container – very little quantum of veg pulao topped with some moong dal and lauki preparation!

Yes, the quantity served is pretty low, but one can’t complain when he is paying just 59 bucks for a meal!

Coming to the food, since their funda is unadulterated healthy food, hence, they serve very nutritious stuff without compromising the taste much, which is quite remarkable in itself!

Pulao was well prepared with an amalgamation of decently chopped varied veggies and went well with the daal and lauki sabji!

Nice to see that food was warm when received – overall a pretty good experience for a very low price!

Will order some healthy food from them again pretty soon!",positive

4859,"Aalmir Restaurant - Definitely a hidden gem of Kolkata.
If you are tired of having ricket chicken biryani from Aminia while shopping in new market area then you can try Aalmir restaurant near Tipu Sultan Mosque.

Try to avoid ground floor rush and directly head towards 1st floor AC family section. They are offering really cheap and delicious North Indian delicacy.
Excellent tender succulent mutton in biryani. Superb mutton chanp (4 big soft mutton pieces) with hot n crispy tandoori roti are must try. Last but not the least don't forget to try chicken tandoori.
Mutton Biriyani 140/- (4.5/5)
Tandoori Roti 15/- (5/5)
Mutton Chanp 120/- (4/5)

And am in love with their TCC's Chicken Wings, they are certainly leave your mood uplifted. Fish and strip too is a good take on this British staple. But it is their pepperoni pizza that I found disappointing. The taste of the pepperoni is flat. If you are a pork lover it would be a good idea to order some other pizza and add bacon to it. We also order food from this place quite often. If you are ordering food from here please remember that their pizza packing is not good.",positive

941,That should be 4.5 not 4. Not much to add to the great legacy of Mitra Cafe. Just reach Mitra Cafe by at least 5pm if you want to lay your hands on those famous brain chops that are an absolute party in your mouth. Fish Kabiraji comes next. And of course the legendary Diamond fry. Yet to see anyone serve boiled potato as side with kashundi so that too makes Mitra Cafe a one-of-a-kind place that is backed by quick service and affable waiters. They have marketed the name quite well but I somehow feel the authenticity can be felt only at the original place. So head out to Mitra Cafe Shovabazar for an evening snack with a difference.,positive

7038,Being a Chickpea Lover I ordered “Pirates Lentil Salad” which was very good.It was accompanied with “Lime Vinaigrette” dressing which turned out to be a great combination.It tasted fresh and was sufficient for one person.Keeping the health conscious people in mind they served salad in a jar instead of regular plastic bowls as the latter might be unorganic.The best part was one can eat salad in that Jar only.No need to pour into bowl.Information regarding calorie count is also available in the jar.,positive

It has chicken in it only and may be some egg as well. And the chicken pieces in hot garlic chicken were small. But if you look into the price of the combo. It's absolutely fine. And even in total the amount is enough to make you full. Taste wise it's really good. And I loved that actually I got spicy hot garlic chicken. Loved it ❤️.,positive

Location is between Girish park and vivekanand crossing. The outer looks very ordinary. SO it looks when you get in, Decent sitting arrangement (As per that time). There was only one staff who was running the entire resto, Who took the order from us and made the food too. We ordered Panir butter masala as well as Tandoori roti. The much i remember that the food did not met the expectations at that time. But after so long time when i passed this place again, i think there is a second and fresh visit is due.

5415,"In the mid-1960s, when Kolkata was still Calcutta, a resident Welsh sociologist told a British TV channel, “Bombay is just an overgrown fishing village. New Delhi is merely a company town, the company being the government. India’s only truly organic city is Calcutta.”. Since then, Kolkata still has been the pioneering city in Indian renaissance. It has long been known for its literary, artistic, revolutionary heritage and food. As the former capital of India, and now known as the “Cultural Capital of India”, not only Kolkata, but Bengal is the birthplace of modern Indian inventions in the field of literature and high-quality cookeries with amazing artistic and scholastic thought. Bengalis tend to have a special appreciation for art and flavour; its tradition of welcoming new taste with full of talent has made it a “city of intense creative energy”.

9420,"I visited here for lunch at late afternoon so rush was less at that time. The place was not so big but was cozy enough. I ordered Tandoori Roti, Peas Pulao and Murg Bharta. I must say the service was extremely slow despite non peak time.

Tandoori Roti -

I was different from other Tandoori Roti found in other places as maximum amount of wheat flour was used thus it became crispy after a while. There was nothing special, just simple kind of roti.

Peas Pulao -

A very simple kind of rice with few peas (I think the price is high) and for flavor, cloves were present. It was somewhat cold. Quantity was enough for 2 people.

Murg Bharta -

Quantity was OK and was garnish with grated paneer and processed cheese. Chicken pcs were hard and small. Not much spicy but the taste was average.

Staff was good and the place was clean. Ambiance was cool and calm. Few improvements are required towards quality of the food otherwise it is a good place for a casual lunch/dinner at reasonable price.",negative
7495,"Location: Very easy to locate. Located just behind the New Alipore petrol pump.

Ambience: Don't expect beautiful ambience and decor. It is one of the oldest place in town serving authentic Chinese food at a very cheap price.

Food: Now coming to the food. If you want amazing Chinese food at an affordable place this is the one. Momos, wontons, Drums of Heaven, noodles, mixed fried rice, choupseys are of special mention. Chicken sweet corn soup, Sweet and sour Chicken, Chilli Pork, Manchurian Chicken are must try items. Highly recommended. If ambience doesn't matter please do visit this place. They serve amazing food at a pretty affordable price.

This place proffers an ordinary look, although its platters are extraordinary. On the grounds of this reason, it has grown its demand on the metro city as well.

As my craving had turned me into a famished beast, so my friend, being a semi-regular visitor, had decreed for Beef Biryani with Beef Bhuna and Beef Chap. Believe me, I anticipated for a bone in it, but pieces were so tender in every cuisines we had ordered, that it didn't take much time to finish it.

9383,"Spending my weekends in Jadavpur . Bon Ami always enlightened my weekend brunch with awesome Chinese cuisine. This place is a small Chinese hub. Where best Chinese is delivered at the most reasonable price. Fish Fry and Pan Fried Momo is a must try of the starters. Devil Chicken and Prawn Fried Rice one of the most relished dish of Bon Ami. The food is very fresh and has lovely and distinct flavours of spices. If it's best Chinese with a handsome pocket , it must be Bon Ami.",positive
9003,"I would have rated it a 4 but for the fact that the Rava onion dosa that they served me was served with small chopped raw onions. Imagine..this place with its high reputation, doing do. Probably they got the order wrong and realized that instead of plain rava dosa the order was for onion rava and the chef just sprinkled the onions and it was brought to the table and served to me. The onions should have been sauteed on one side of the dosa which would have made them slightly translucent and sweet and enhanced the taste. The service too was slow. The masala vada was also not to my liking. I've had much better ones in the various south Indian food joints in the city.The coffee too was so mild that the aroma of south Indian filter coffee was missing.
Lovely decor with pics from Malgudi junction on the wall. They have utilised the small space well. But my food experience was thoroughly disappointing.",negative

It's a tiny little place and was damn chaotic. Its more of a family restaurant. We had a group of people sitting immediate to us and because of them we could not hear ourselves properly and the staff were way to scared to ask them to yell a little less.

It was an okayish experience.
Food though was good. Quantity was also okay. You can get various options for drinks as well.

9336,"The Regan Inn is a popular fast food centre for Parnashree locals. It is situated in the midst of Parnashree Crossing almost adjacent to Chopsticks.

Mostly ordered here are rolls which are fairly decent in taste. Saucy and hot in the inside with big chunks of protein and a fat piece of bread to wrap everything in.

This place has an open kitchen so you would get to see your orders in making. Sadly this place does not have a proper sitting area. Service is fast and Kolkata's street food essence is strongly felt here.

Negative: not much hygienic, especially during monsoon.

I was bit disappointed by seeing the Biryani in foil, but that went away when I saw a big chicken piece in it. I dug inside and found an egg too. A little more in, it uncovered a giant potato.

Chicken piece was extremely tasty, juicy & soft.
Biryani rice was extremely well made, fully packed with flavours and rich in texture. Potato, once again was soft and well cooked too. This Biryani tasted just wonderful. Portion was okey too. It was definitely better than standard delivery restaurants.

2. Quantity: pretty poor except mutton biriyani which was standard
3. Taste & quality: below avg to avg, the hilsa biriyani tasted extremely salty & without any actual taste. The chingri wasn't of good quality either & that just the lower half provided. The scourge of poorly boiled mutton comes back to haunt again

I'd describe the food here as- Starters have less options, maincourse is okayish, dessert makes up for starter and main course. Dessert section here is loveeeely! 💕
Okay, now I need to say something about the buffet here. Nearbuy app coupons were available for Alfresco lunch buffet at 799 per person. But on reaching there they informed us we could have used the coupon only if we had informed them beforehand in the morning. Now I don't know what's the process of informing and all that but this part was definitely disturbing. So we finally settled for non-veg buffet at Rs 1009 each getting the happy hours offer.
Hospitality here is, hands-down, awesome. The ambience is amazing too.
Pro tip: Go at sharp 12.30 pm (That's when the lunch buffet starts), then you'll have ample time in your hand. Buffet closes at 3 pm. Eat to your fullest in this 2 and half hours and you won't regret. 🤗",positive

Always a great go to spot for a classic bakery and sweet shop to indulge in various baked delicacies whether it be the vast range of cakes and pastries to the freshly baked savories to go along with high tea. 

Flurys has barely disappointed in the past and I doubt will do in the future. Also if you’re looking for a classic English style breakfast, this place is a good choice as perhaps this was one of the first places to actually start serving that kind of food in the city. Definitely a favorite and highly recommend to anyone who’s new to town and looking for good a good place to indulge.",positive

We pulled a seat in front and waited for our turn to come.The place is always crowded so make sure to reach early.Finally the plate of goodness arrived.The fresh out of the oven littis was served with an equally delicious chokha.The chokha is basically boiled potatoes mashed with spices ,tomato and chilli.The mash tasted so good that you would ask for a second helping.

At a steal deal of 30 bucks a plate with six ghee soaked stuffed balls ,this is sheer love.

Their biriyani is spicy and doesnt have a great taste though😊
The chicken dishes that they prepare are all amazing..",positive
2975,"The location of the place is a bit odd. It is tucked in a corner. From the outside it looks like a very cozy cafe.
They are a bakery so they also make their own bread. Their breakfast menu has an entire selection of egg preparation. I tried one such preparation, it was bland, if it was intentional so that the customer can sprinkle salt & pepper according to taste then it is understandable.
The latte was pretty good.

The staff was incredibly polite.
All in all this is a quiet little hide away.",negative

What attracted ke initially was the affordable rates although I did have some reservations about the quality and quantity.

It was packed with care so that the crispiness of the items stay intact. The burgers were bigger than an average burger we get and had a thick crispy chicken patty layered with cheese. Taste 4.5/5. One burger down I was already full. The popcorn chicken was ample in quantity and is enough for 3 people. Taste 4/5. Overall a pretty good experience.

We ordered:
●Kappi Fizz:
This was a strongly caffeinated drink with black coffee and ThumsUp.
●Crispy Karuvipillai Baby corn:
It was so nice to have something other than crispy chilli baby corn or schezwan baby corn. Amazing dry sauce made with curry leaves, and coconut milk. Had the right amount of coastal spice.
●Veg Moilee with Appam:
Sadly, the waiter didn't take our order correctly. He heard babycorn as chicken which we corrected soon and Vegetable Kurma as Moilee which we realised later. This preparation was good in the light coconut milk broth.. but we realised the mistake in the order after we got the bill.
Apart from this flaw in the service, we loved the place and would like to go in again.

It was sort of steaming hot water with some boiled veggies. In short, compared to the price the platter was not at all satisfying.

For main course we had schezwan mixed rice and hunan chicken. To our disappointment the main course was not as tasty as expected. Though it was a nice sophisticated place. Looking forward to visit again. 😊",positive

3548,"As the name says this place wants people to have rice.I had a combo over here which has got almost everything they serve from roomali roti to papad.It had - 

1)Zeera Rice – The rice was tasty and quantity was for one person only.I will recommend Steamed Rice instead of Zeera Rice as it would have tasted better with Paneer Butter Masala.

2)Paneer Butter Masala – It was actually very tasty.

3)Dal Makhni – It was so good that I would love to come here again especially for their dal makhni

4)Roomali Roti – Could have been a bit softer

5)Raita – They serve salty version.It tasted average.I will recommend sweet version.

6)Papad & Pickles – Fine.

P.S. – They maintain hygiene.Quantity needs to be improved keeping in mind the price they are charging.",positive

Last week I ordered from here after seeing some positive reviews of this delivery outlet and Babul didn't make me disappoint. I opted for their best seller murgh tikka butter masala and one veg fried rice and two makhanwala naan.

The murgh tikka butter masala was one of the best chicken dish I had recently. Six huge Boneless chicken pieces with delicious gravy went perfectly with fried rice and naan. The quantity of rice was good. The naan was also soft, loved it.

Overall a great experience. Going to order soon to try out their other dishes.",positive

This place is apt for take aways n home delivery

Mixed burnt ginger capsicum rice which was too good in flavour with the side dish

It comprised of 1 masala kulcha, paneer, black Dal, mix veg, Pulao, gulab jamun, raita, papad. The dishes tasted well. Not much complaint except nothing was really outstanding either. Mix veg was surprisingly the best dish. The rest were decent, but average.",negative

Something which we love mostly is there rolls.
The menu does not give you a lot of varieties to select from but it does have a compact ones.
The ones that i would like to mention are:

Chicken cheese roll : This buddy is super filling. Loaded with grilled chicken and cheese. This thing can please you a lot.

Chicken Biriyani: The basic one but their quantity is commendable.

These are the 2 things we literally order 2 times a week.
But there are a few pointers that i mention.
The food served by them is good but it not served hot. Their in house delivery needs a lot of brush up.
Apart from this everything here is just fine keeping in mind the price point and quality offered by these people.",negative

You can read books, play your favourite songs on the guitar hear or even choose to click with the beautiful decor all around, every arrangement is here. I went here along with a friend. We didn't have much of an appetite and settled for a chicken cheese fries. Loved it as well and the portion was quite good enough for the two of us. We also ordered a chocolate peanutbutter milkshake and a choco frappe along with the food. The menu infact has a huge range of items in the beverage section. The highlight of the day was the creme brulee. It served on a plate with some blueberry compote and a shortbread cookie. Loved it. Must try if you are here. They also have a good all day breakfast menu here and the main course dishes on the menu will surely be good as well.
I however feel, they can add in a bit more in the starters.Maybe something with fish. A really nice otherwise to meet and have long conversations over some good food and coffee.",positive
3697,"Had heard good reviews about this place so decided to go for dinner one evening. Located on the first floor of PS Magnum building in Kaikhali. Place is quite small with a seating space of not more than 20-25 people. Dark and gloomy ambience and too congested. You don’t need to keep it dark for a south Indian eatery. Couches were not comfortable and dirty. Started with masala fried idlis and then went on to order cheese dosa, plain dosa, rava masala dosa, veggie Uttapam and regular masala dosa. Masala fried idlis were quite good and crispy. Toppings of tomatoes and onions gave it a distinctive taste. Dosas and uttapam came. Potato Stuffing of dosas were not good at all. Sambhar was extremely sweet and even all chutneys were very sweet. This takes away that flavour from your south Indian dishes. Uttapam was very ordinary with little amount of stuffing. Service and prices were ok.",negative
151,"One of the best biriyani joints in and around Kolkata. Kebabs and other items are equally good if not better. Special mention of the Cheese Chicken Kebab (might have a different name).

Service is extremely good.",positive

808,"Location- It is Located at the Ground floor of the Park Mansion, and can be easily seen from the main road.

Orders- We ordered for the following dishes

1. Hot Chocolate

2. Brewed Coffee. 

3. Frappuccino Mocha.

Serve- You have to take your own food, so it pretty much depends on how much the crowd is and how difficult it is, to make your food. But honestly, it doesn't take much time 10 minutes (max). 

Ambience- It is Good and a cozy place to chill and gossip, and have a dining capacity for 40 people (Approx)

Quality- The quality of the food was good, All the drinks were really good especially the Frappuccinos, except the Brewed coffee, it was very bitter in taste, and we had to end up drinking it forcefully, for the sake of money. 

Price- From the price point of view it is a bit on the higher side, to be honest.

Being one of the most popular company around the globe for coffee, it does worth it!!

Sunayena isn’t your fine dining restaurant but somewhere to go to after being npo(nil per oral) for hours. The good part is they deliver at our hospital and has helped us not go hungry on oncall days and nights when it’s nearly impossible for us to leave the hospital and go out to eat.

The salad preparation was good. In the main course they had chicken, fish, lamb, paneer and Manchurian recipes, also fried rice and Thai hakka noodles which was prepared really well .

Each and every item they have is a top notch starting from doda, idli, sada vada dahi Vada, puri sabji, upma, pongal. They have variety of dosa and the rava masala Dosa is a must try. Their uttapams are also too good, thick filled with onion, tomato, capsicums.

In proper Sealdah area, it's hard to find quality Chinese restaurants, what they give, is usually quantity. Sonali is not quite bad restaurant...Compared to most of the nearby ones.
Food quality is average,, soups are quite good, chowmein , fried rice, chicken etc are average. I don't like the prawn preparations here usually. The quantity is humongous...half plate rice is more than sufficient for one person.
Only interesting thing is...Some food items, like *Sesame chicken (picture given), Jack fried Chicken, Sliced chicken with baby corn & mushroom, ...These items are unique and pretty good to eat. They are rarely found in any other restaurants.
Very inexpensive. There's no point of ambience here. Fast supply of food. Hygiene might be questionable.

1023,"Bit late to upload my review. I visited the restaurant on Bhaiphota. The interior is mind blowing, it carries an essence of royalty. The prices are pocket friendly and though the restaurant is new in the city, the food can give a good competition to the other mughlai restaurants of the city.
The #Chicken_Tandoori was spicy and creamy and tasted as yummy as it looked. #Naan was tender and #Chilli_Chicken was hot and spicy. The #Chicken_Biriyani beared the perfect traditional taste of Kolkata's Biriyani. However, #Mutton_Roganjosh was not up to the mark in compared to others.

I really wish to go back to taste the #Chicken_Tandoori and the #Chicken_Biriyani once more.",positive

1569,"This place won my heart with their ambience and food. We wanted to spend the lazy morning in any of the cafe to have some breakfast and this was the place. Its quite a bit tricky to find while you drive on road as the entrance is small and someone may easily miss it. However look for the one adjacent to Kotak Mahindra Bank and you will get this location. We ordered Nutella Pancake, Chicken BBQ pizza and Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream. The pancake was the best out of all as per my taste. Each one of the dish was a treat for the eyes and taste buds. The staff was very courteous and also the owner was very friendly. I will surely visit someday near to tryout something else.",positive
6336,"It was takeaway order. We ordered 3 egg fried rice and 2 chilli chicken (gravy). The total bill was 480 which is reasonable according to me. Now for the price i paid, the amount of food i got was absolutely wonderful. 3 packets of fried rice was more than enough for 4 people of moderate appetite. Each plate of chilli chicken had 8 succulent pieces.

For the price i paid, i am totally amazed for the amount of food i got.
This was my first visit.
Hope to visit them soon 😊",positive
3468,"This is a small takeaway joint which serves 70 types of rolls. This outlet is 100% vegetarian. Also they serve potato twisters.

So we tried --

Baked pizza roll
Paneer Kathi roll
Bhoot jolokiya roll
Maggi roll
Nutella banana roll
Peri peri twister

Bhoot jolokiya roll is very spicy and recommend to not choose. Baked pizza roll is really delicious amd had liquid cheese and toppings stuffed. Also loved their twister. Roll lovers do visit.

- Chicken Steam Momo (disappointed- less sign of chicken and rather onion was filled in huge amount making it taste bad and smelly).

I felt they used more than enough spices and made it extraordinarily rich. That is why we felt so heavy. This is the first time I tried Malabar Chicken Curry.

The bad is the unhygienic conditions the food is prepared and for pure vegans you can give this place a miss.

The coating was thin, and quality was speaking for itself. Only downside: they don't serve 'kasundi'.

We had ordered mixed noodles, which was not only great in quantity but also boasting in terms of its toppings - chicken, prawn, and pork.

1. Tenderloin Steak(3.5/5): The Tenderloin was a bit raw, a little bit undercooked in my opinion. The neighbouring Kaffiesta has a far better Tenderloin steak to offer, if you ask me.

For Main course Mutton Nali with garlic naan, Mutton Raan Biryani and the Guchhi Dal which is a different version of Dal Makhani cooked overnight for 12 hours.

Definitely you can try them out one of the best at that area. Rice dish and Meifun is very tasty and so was the garlic chicken.And Quantity is also proportionate to its price.

6497,"A sign of the changing times when you find Chicken Biryani and Mutton Biryani listed on Bengal Hotel's menu but try and focus on the real deal here --- the way they treat their fish. Okay I must admit their legendary battered fish (aka Butter fry) is less fishy these days but once you break into their fish rolls you would understand why Bengal Hotel still stands tall among these new joints. Wonderfully fishy, a little sweet and a distinct taste of those two layers are what you will get from Bengal's fish roll, their best export I believe. Also do try their kosha mangsho with fried rice or crisp toast to get a taste of what old fare at Kolkata cabins used to be like. One of my earliest memories of eating out took shape here. That Bengal Hotel still tugs at my heart like the days of yore makes it a very special place indeed. Small request: Pls do not ever change that name board. I don't think anybody writes 'Fowl' anymore!",positive

The dosa had been crisp and freshly-made; the chutney and sambar had been tasty as well.
The tea too had been quite a refreshing beverage for high tea.

Flurys original open Swiss sandwich was horrible to the core. Either they don't know how a Swiss sandwich is like our they are just fooling people around. All the vegetables were overcooked and soaked in oil. Chicken filled Croissant honestly didn't taste like a heritage dish.

One doesn’t expect to find a completely vegetarian place when they walk into a restaurant at Kolkata, and there are no marks or representations outside or on the signboard to indicate the same. If you walk in here without researching it, you will be sorely disappointed as I was during the Pujo this year (2018)

Coming to the food itself: The appetiser and the entrées are innovative and interesting, you might enjoy them if you like vegetarian.
The main course will remind you of a North Indian Dhaba, and if that’s what you were looking for then you will enjoy it, else you should stay away.

I give it a three for the wonderful servers, and the good suggestions they provide, very few places have such exceptional and excellent servers who are interactive yet absolutely non intrusive and extremely well informed.",negative

I visited it last evening again to suppress my cravings for tanduri ruti and Mutton Kasa. Though some people may say that its quality has fallen but I find it quite good. I have visited this joint so many times that I have become familiar to the staffs. It was a nice evening indeed.

It is really impossible to find the location without google maps!there is outdoor seating arrangement as well!
we ordered:

Bacon wrapped chicken -- Now it is not like usual bacon wrapped chicken. The bacon is not fried. Breadcrumbs coated chicken fingers are deep fried and rolled in a bacon.

Meat lovers club sandwich-- This is a ultimate sandwich for all meat lovers. Chicken, ham, cheese and egg clubbed inside grilled bread. It was too heavy to kill your appetite for next dish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Overall a wonderful experience. Would like to visit their steakhouse next time.",positive

10790,I have grown up in this locality and tried their food quite a few times. It's one the most unhygenic food joints I ever came across. They have an open kitchen and yet it's ugly to its core. Tastewise it's comparable to any other street side stalls in the city. It doesn't check any of the boxes to fall into the 'recommended' or 'worth a try' list.,negative

I am not comparing them with big restaurant like dada boudi or Kasturi but it can provide you best dishes without making hole in your pocket.. tandoori chicken is the best dish... U can't find such great tandoori chicken in any restaurant of Barrackpore. We celebrated a birthday party over here and the staffs of this restaurant help us alot in celebration..",positive

9797,"My review is based on my food delivery experience, I didn't dine in this establishment.

I ordered

1. Chicken kabiraji
2. Chicken tikka roll
3. Fish batter fry
4. Chicken Mughlai paratha.

1. The chicken kabiraji was decent. It tasted good and had a fairly decent chicken breast in it.

2. The chicken tikka roll was awful, to begin with the paratha was soggy, and the sauce or ketchup what ever you called it, was the local coloured stuff that you see in road side food stalls.

3. Fish batter fry, I love fish batter fry so order 2 pieces of it. I was very disappointed to see two aloor chop like fish batter fry delivered to me, and one of them was not properly cooked.

4. The chicken Mughali Partha was drenched in oil, I squeezed out quite a few drops of oil from it, the stuffing lacked of taste and chicken . All I could taste was doughy thing that was used as a binder .",negative
8196,"A small outlet serving multi cuisines . I was attracted by its name. A bit catchy, isn’t it?
Unfortunately when I went there, they had nothing to offer apart from fish fry and I asked for parcel. The parcel was hygienic and no spill was there. The fish fry was a large one with chips accompanying it. Not bad. The price is reasonable. You can see the preparation being made directly so no question of the food not being hygienic enough. They have installed umbrella seats but on that day it was so rainy that they were hardly of use. Anyway would love to try gandhoraj fish sometime.",positive
7544,"I went here for dinner a couple of days back.... while it has improved a lot from my previous experiences but still there is room for a lot more improvement. The price is slightly on the higher side considering the other options available locally. 

Areas of improvement:
1) Area is very small. In the small area I would prefer less seats.
2) Tables,chairs, Cutlery need upgrade. 
3) May be employ one more staff. I could see only one person serving all the tables hence waiting time is a bit more.

But not to forget the food was served HOT and tasted good. 

Still a long way to go ...",negative

The place had a good crowd. It had three areas, a dance floor, the sitting area and the bar counter with tables. There was a display board with price for the drinks varying like the share market. We ordered Jim Beam and Jeigermeister as the prices were on the lower side. However, the overall prices were pretty much on the higher side. Also, the food menu was limited to finger foods. But even that was expensive considering the quantity they serve.

Another disadvantage they have is due to licence limitation they close at 12am and they literally push you out of the place by 12am. So if you are a party animal, this is not the place for u.",negative

Food: Now coming to the food.This place is famous for the amazing food they serve at a very cheap rate. Recently visited this place with a group of friends. And the dishes we ordered were:

1.Chicken Steamed Momo: Came in 5pcs. Soft from inside. Tasted good.

2.Chicken Panfried Momo: Totally in love with this. Highly Recommended.

3. Chicken Hakka Noodles: Tasted great and came in a huge quantity. But somehow they should add more chicken pieces into it. Recommended.

Totally in love with this place. Hope to visit again.",positive

The veggies were uncooked and the rice was also a massacre.When we ordered,they showed some other pictures of the rice combo and gave in turn just a ""disgusting"" dish. Just wasted my bucks...This restaurant is such a disgrace.

Double cheese double veggie pizza(4/5): pizza made from hard crusted ready made pizza bread, readily available in groceries, usually proves to be a major turn down for me. And this is exactly what they use. But, the wonderful toppings completely made up for it. Every single bite gave me the taste of fresh veggies and loads of cheese. Loved it!

▪️ Chowman special rice : The quantity was humongous. Loved the flavour of the rice, there was enough shredded chicken and good sized prawns.

▪️ Crab meat in Chilli basil : Tried crab after a long time and was satisfied to be honest. The preparation was good. Though found some tiny crab shell pieces in the dish.

▪️ Kung pao chicken : The best dish of the day. The flavour, the spices, the aroma was perfectly blended. Went really well with the rice item.

next the hariyali kebab.. was full of flavours.. too good..
the paella came next n won our hearts.. a half plate was enough fr 2 people n we loved it.. it had jumbo prawns.. bacon.. sausage.. chicken..peas n other veggies n was super charging..
the Mediterranean chicken was more of a lemony chicken thick soup and tasted great on its own.. mango lassi was a dessert in itself...

10298,"Located 4 no. tank island at Salt Lake City. This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. We had ordered for a mutton biriyani, butter naan and Kadai chicken.

The mutton biryani was the worst one out of the three dishes (perhaps the worst biriyani ever had) followed by butter naan. The biriyani was only plain white rice quite dry in nature and with a typical smell of saffron coming out from it and the mutton piece was only a bone. The butter naan was better than the biriyani but worst thing about it was there wasn't any butter on it.

Talking about the service, these people should learn the basics before running a restaurant. The waiters were too much confused with orders and we had to call them multiple times just to change the glasses but that wasn't done till the time we left.

Seriously it was a horrible experience here.",negative

3289,"This was my first visit to this outlet. I ordered a Baked Momo Augratin in chicken. The server sought 15 minutes and it was delivered on time. The browned baked cheese cover was tempting and it was delicious.

But an unpleasant culinary surprise followed. The momos under the cheese cover were pan fried and the sauce was terribly pungent. I can handle spicy dishes but the spiciness was strong enough to put me off. The AC wasn't working too but I didn't really mind that as the server had acknowledged it in an apologising tone.

I find the recipe odd! Does one expect an extremely spicy dish to go under the cover of baked cheese? I expected something light and subtle.

Next time onwards, I shall stick to my choice of steamed momos and maybe thukpa.

Basically this place is for Hookah but the food quality is not up to the mark

Pocket pinch- As affordable as you can think of.

Nevertheless I like the food here but yes you don't have enough things to do here like other resorts. The management is okayish. But for people who likes crowd this is certainly not the place for you because it's too quite like I dunn even know half of the kolkata people even know about this place.

11289,Located opposite to gunjan restaurant in college Street... This restaurant serves biriyanis and chaps at very cheap rate... It is better to go for take away because sitting area is not so good... First time tried their chicken biriyani which cost only INR 90. It was huge in quantity.. I couldn't finish it!! Really like my first experience from this place.. If you want good biriyani in cheap rate then go for it!!!,positive
7460,"A nice cozy place, good for some quality time as the place was almost empty when I visited on a weekend.

They have hookah too, so ultimately becomes a good place to spend some time with your group of friends, spacious enough and sitting areas are also comfortable.

Tried their two mocktails and nachos, both of them were good enough in taste. They can try to make the mocktails better.

Overall a good place to visit with group of friends.

There's a variety of sandwiches available from Veg Aloo Tikka Sandwich to Chicken Cheese Sandwich. There are Egg Sandwiches as well.

The shop is located just across Khadya Bhavan and is a happening one. We went around 3 pm and the shop was buzzing with people, everyone ordering some or the sandwich. They do serve the sandwich there and if you want takeaway, they pack it up for you as well.

Overall it's a nice shop to have sandwiches when you're hungry after your shopping spree.

Cheese Fondue: Amazing flavours and as i mentioned before the cheese here is just lip smacking! I would recommend this dish.

Roesti in Creme Mushroom Sauce: The roesti was really delicious and it tasted well and tagged along with the mushroom sauce.

Cream of Broccoli Soup: Though I am not a fan of Broccoli at all, if you wanna get over your phobia against Broccoli try this soup, it's just YUMMY! 

Tricolour Pasta: Well I loved the concept of bringing three flavours together, but I felt the red sauce portion wasn't up to to the mark, otherwise it was good.

Green Apple Mocktail: Though this mocktail tasted good, the flavour wasn't near green apple at all. 

Overall a great place for cheese lovers and a quick bite to make your taste buds experience some delicious cheese-based dishes at just 800 INR for 2 people pocket pinch.

I took my parents out to this place and ran off to the dessert section that boasts of 30+ items. Quite a few are from the sugar free area, so the diabetics can also dig in. The Gateaux absolutely melts in your mouth.

There were choices amongst Bengali, Chinese, Oriental and Continental amongst the buffet and the food will not disappoint.

I only wish we got a seat next to the windows, as the view is better there.

But the decision was a complete disaster as the naan was burnt and oily, not soft as a naan should be but very chewy. Along with that the paneer preparation turned out to be some raw paneer cubes floating on a sea of oil and some thick curry paste which was totally tasteless. Moreover they didn't put any salt in the paneer dish which all the more contributed to my horrible experience. Couldn't eat my food after few mouthfulls and had to dispose it off to the bin with my money going the same way too.",negative

All you'll get is a single chunk of chicken in it, a whole boiled potato and an egg. And to mention, you'll need to pay extra for raita and sherwa. Maybe, that's the essence of Bangla biriyani everywhere as I find it the same everywhere here. Later, after a few tries I am kinda liking this type too.

Paneer Kathi roll - Gosh this one was a true delight with the soft well cooked pieces of paneer inside it.

Totally loved the ambiance of OTT along with the music. A toast to the DJ! (Though music was too loud & I personally feel it is helpful to have at least one comparatively silent corner in a pub to take important phone calls)
Coming to food & drinks, we had nachos, pasta, kebabs, beer, cocktail & hookah.
Sorry to say .. pretty lousy service.
The staff is not well aware of the menu; they took a lot of time to understand that Jamaican punch is a cocktail & not breezer.
Moreover we were pretty hungry & had to ask them again & again what will be readily available from the food menu.
The hookah pipe was leaking & they had no clue what was wrong or how to fix it.
Also, a single common washroom is a bit disappointing in a place like this.
The good part is this place is easy on the pocket, along with good food.

Nevertheless OTT was fun!

The ambience is just amazing and refreshing for a leisurely afternoon or evening after the daily office grind for get together.

Had been skeptical owing to it's moderate brand of mock-tails but frankly speaking we were taken by surprise. 
The drinks are moderately priced w.r.t similar Restaurants.

The variety of Non Vegetarian Starters they serve with the drinks do a world of good.

The ordered dishes were superbly done.
Kebabs with just perfect grilling. The portions served were sufficient, generous in quantity. Fish Tikka Masala and Palak Kadhai needs a special mention.

The service is good, perhaps a bit slow to some respects but overall can say the quality and taste of food offered was outstanding for the price tag.

I think the either-a-flashy-bulb-or-sit-in-the-dark concept should be chucked. A minimal central light is not that bad. Because of which everytime from eating to getting good pics we had to switch the light on and off. Otherwise everything was worthwhile.,positive

3007,"Potstickers is a cozy little place located near Jatin Das Park metro station. Heard a lot about it and finally paid a visit this year Durga puja, Saptami. And to be honest it was a wonderful experience.

The place is very small, but the ambience is nice and comfortable on its own way. We (count three) opted for their best seller dragon chicken along with veg spicy schezwan rice, mixed fried rice and chicken shyapta.

The rice items were great, with good quantity easily can be shared. Both the rice items went really well with the side dishes. Dragon chicken was a bit spicy but really loved the mouthwatering dish. But the dish which stole the show was Chicken shyapta, the well tossed sauces made it perfect.
The price is very much affordable, gst is included in the menu which is another plus point for foodies like me. Service was quick.

We visited this place during Puja and it was over crowded and menu was selective and pre set. We had roasted chilly porks, and pepper fried chicken as starter. The porks were a bit fleshy but the taste was awesome. The chicken preparation was soft and juicy and it was a bit spicy as tossed with green chillies. Then we had mixed hakka noddles, mixed fried rice with chilly fish. The fish preparation was loved by all containing 8large pieces of fish and the gravy was medium spicy. The noodles was perfectly prepared and so also the rice.",positive

2132,"I have been obsessively ordering double beef rolls and Bhuna beef kababs from this tiny place called Zafran. Hands down, beats most other places in town in tests of taste and portion size. A full plate of bhuna beef kabab (second photo) is 75/- and makes one hungry girl extremely happy. Served with some lime and onion slices, this was a rather satiating meal. The same goes into the beef rolls, and they are simply put together, with a couple of chillies on the side, crisp, flaky paranthe, and a bit of onion to add to the crunch factor. I am yet to try their biryani, but if the kababs are this good, I am quite sure the biryani would be quite good too!

Sodpur for quite some time now! The Food that they serve is really something is cherished. I had placed order at home and here is my experience.

Crispy chicken: Perfect! Well, that is exactly as you can explain it. The crispy chicken was perfect. A crispy layer of coating and a juicy chicken wrapped inside it is something that would have taken anyone by a delightful surprise!

Tandoori roti: Well, as it happens mostly when u get your food delivered at your place, the roti are all cheery, but that was not the case here! The rotis still appeared to be soft and had the flair of the food served.

Chicken Bharta: It was good to taste, but yes was too spicy which would have been avoided. I take away one star from the restaurant because of this!

Have also tried a mix veg roti combo which was normal, nothing extraordinary.
Have also tried spaghetti here, had amazing garlic piece's, only if they had less oil it would have been perfect.
Fried rice and manchurian was abundant in quantity and tasted great. Have also tried fries here which was full soggy at the time it reached me, no complains for the same though.

Only if they have their price's a bit less, I would have ordered more frequently. Consider this outlet for any corporate lunches and you won't be disappointed.",positive

8547,"Done justice to the name, have Dacre's Lane. They have truly brought the flavours of the many famous age old food joints of Dacre's Lane to South Kolkata. A hidden gem in every way. The rolls are fantastic, the Kadhai Mutton and Chicken Bharta are delectable. But the stand out item was Mutton Stew, which was ambrosial in the truest sense.
It was my good luck that they had sent an extra plate of Mutton Stew by mistake and I felt it was my responsibility to inform them and pay for it. But on calling up, they made a lovely gesture of making it complementary for us.
Loved the food. This place has certainly relieved us of the efforts of going down to the legendary outlets at Dacre's Lane. Instead, they have gifted us the luxury to order from the comfort of our homes and yet enjoy the same taste (specially for people of South Kolkata). Deserve a 4.5, but then again...the ratings are restricted.",positive

Veg Tomato Soup – This tasted more of a Chinese soup instead of the regular tomato based! The sauces as well as veggies used in preparation were more of those used in the manchows – my verdict - fine on taste, though not great!
Dal Makhani – The item of the day – pretty tasty, but somewhat oily – to impart the taste punch!
Tawa Roti – Tawa phulkas prepared sans ghee – well done, went pretty well with the somewhat oily dal makhani!
Plain Papad - they served fried papad (instead of the regular roasted ones) – way too oily and this was more of a big let-down.
Thumbs Up
Prices are very high and sad to see Zomato delay so much in delivery. Packing is aptly suitable and quantity served is fine.

They have a separate bakery section and ice cream section as well.

The place has an elegant aura with its cozy seating and warm hospitality. The thinking behind the place is commendable and deserves your visit.",positive
3698,"Chennai Square opened its doors in PS Magnum commercial complex in Kaikhali, VIP Road, Kolkata and fused modern dining with the traditional South Indian cuisines. The decor has been done extremely well, keeping in mind the small space for a restaurant. There are high chairs to accommodate single person seating, as if sitting in a bar. There are only 4 tables that can hold 16-18 people at a go. The tables are cramped. But the lighting has been done in an aesthetic manner. Soothing music is played. The view of the VIP Road is superb.

652,"Molecular gastronomy as they call it. The best thing are the staff at this place. I should actually appreciate their attitude to celebrate the spirit of this place more than anything else. The food came with a lot of surprises. Mind you, I am not a vegetarian but I totally enjoyed their vegetable kolapuri and consider that as the best dish of the afternoon. The paneer was soft and the ice cream kulfi was super unique. The kulchas were soft and aptly stuffed. The tomato soup sets up the mood and explores your taste buds.

The only dissapointment of the afternoon was the spinach soup which turned out to be too creamy and very spicy. The paw bhaji was average. Yet, the staff pushes the bar at this place and hence they get a 4/5 in food and a 5/5 for the staff.

I am glad I made this visit. Recommended for people looking for a pure vegetarian place with a twist.",positive

Frankly speaking didn't like most of the food. Fish fry was descent but liked the fish pakoda more, fish quality was good, mutton chop was bad, though not expecting anything special at rs 15 but it was like potato chop, didn't found any taste or smell of mutton in it. Mughlai paratha was bad, only onion masala inside so not that tasty, potato curry was very bland. Mutton cutlet, prawn cutlet, vegetable chop were not available.  cheap eatery no doubt, though the prices have gone up than what is shown here in sample menu card but still cheap but they should upgrade the quality little more to be in the competition.",negative

We ordered fish teriyaki maki (sushi) and chicken tempura.
The fish used in the sushi was basa fish. I tasted sushi for the first time here, to my surprise it had a mixture of flavor and i didn't get any raw fishy smell from the sushi. The main taste enhancer was the wasabi it's pungent taste activates all your senses, after which you have a slice of ginger to clean your tongue pallet.
Apart from this the chicken tempura tasted like normal fried chicken served with mayo.
That's my first sushi experience for you.",positive

A perfect chill kind of a place for hangout.
Well coming to the order I ordered cheese mayo fries.
It was my first experience of having fries this way and I wasn't satisfied with it. The price and the quality were just parallel. There was nothing waow about the fries. It was like a basic normal fries cone.

Pizza base was very soft unlike Domino's, with ample amount of toppings in the pizza as you can in my given pictures also. Thats just not the end, then comes their signature Aussis's favourite veg pizza. OMG handsdown one of the best veg pizza i have ever had. Thick layers of mozzarella cheese was there.

4558,Ordered from this restaurant which apparently is run by same chain of restaurants as Koshe Kosha..After enquiring over phone ordered Pork Pad Kra Pao..I clearly mentioned food to be non spicy and without chillies both to him and at Zomato..Food arrives..Delivery boy is extremely rude and unprofessional and screams at me..I have made necessary complaints about him and mailed the authorities..Coming to the food....Extremely spicy...Full of red chillies probably a serrano chillies and almost left a burning aftertaste...Food tasted well but if so much chillies are added inspite of me telling no chillies should be added then what is the point of telling...Overall quite disappointed..Hope this gets addressed and does not fall into blank ears.,negative

So far I know now they are also selling chinese dishes. Though my recommendation is only tandoor and mujhlai items..
.
Food :- Had two types of rolls from tobin road outlet one egg roll for 26 and one double egg double chicken roll for 100. taste ia good, No doubt . And pocket friendly too. But the rolls are so much oily. Quantity is OK. No seating arrangements. The paratha that is used here is Laccha , which gives another dimension to the taste.",positive

Ordered fries, sweet corn soup. Sweet corn soup was horrible, super thick and awful. Same were fries. Ordered their Usual masala kulcha, paneer butter masala and dal Makhani. Paneer butter masala had lost it old charm, Dal Makhani was very average but kulchas were good and stuffy. Overall either this place has gone down in its quality of food or other places have gone up considerably. They should come up to the mark if they want to stay and compete.",negative

57,"People love a fancy place, but do they love a fancy place with average food?

                        I simply loved the atmosphere here. It is carved out of the Exit gate of Swabhumi, which used to be a go-to place for having an amazing evening hangout. Right from the entrance, you can feel the liveliness of the place. Neon lights, plush interiors, pipped music and cool, wintery air. What better can you ask for? The bar is well-decked, not with alcohol though. The open space and brilliant interiors give it an ecstatic look and feel. They have an immense seating place. One is on the outside with clear glass top gazebos, some tables here and there. Then there is a lounge on the second floor, totally covered. They are coming up with the rooftop as well, starting 25th December 2018. I personally loved the “I ♥ UNO” setup.

10771,"I was very pumped to come to this place but sadly once I did I was disappointed. I have no complains about the ambience because it was alright but the food is what made me sad. We took fish Orly and I can say that at best it was ok. We also took Singaporean rice with grilled fish but it was not upto the mark. The grilled fish was over seasoned and it felt like it was thrashed against herbs, weirdly oily. For the rice, it looked more like a yellow pulao which was disappointing which and I couldn't even eat it after one spoon.
I would really want to come back to this place and hopefully it would be better next time around.",negative

It has absolutely retro American style diner decor and the music playing will take you to a different time altogether. I am literally obsessed with their ambience.

The order was given online by my brother from a different location , and when I called and tried to change the delivery time a bit (pre-pone), though initially they told that it may not be possible, but they were very nice in actually delivering half an hour earlier, just as i had requested.

Observations / suggestions :  Ideally, it should have a at least a sweet item and a bhaja to accompany and the no of luchis should be 4, not 2. I feel that would be more useful along with a reduced quantity of rice (perhaps).",positive

1516,"A decent place to try out beef delicacies at a reasonable price is what it used to be. But now the quality has declined. Biriyani is the worst here with hard pieces. The beef kebab is decent. The beef handi kebab, qorma and bhuna are the things to try here, including the winter morning delight nehari. But beware the hardness of the beef fluctuates greatly.

6310,"The thing with many restaurants, particularly the multicusine ones, is that they make some food really well, but mess up with few others. An usual case is that of those which serve both Chinese and North Indian/Tandoor items. So it is often wise to read reviews and then place the order.
I ordered tandoori roti and Rajasthani gatta from here.The roti was warm and soft, and came wrapped in aluminium foil.The gravy item was good enough.They provided salad and Achar with the order.
The plus side is their pricing, which is quite economical.",positive

Last time i went with my friends we ordered the chicken spanish sandwich, panfried chicken momo, cappuccino and a green tea. The sandwich was very tasty. The chicken was not at all fibery. The secret sauce and mayonnaise combination was great. The panfried momo was good too. Only thing to complain is that one has to wait for quite sometime for the food to arrive.",positive

1249,"Ordered food online. To start with, it was packed very well. 😊No spilling of food. We had ordered a veg thali and an egg thali and 2 separate egg dishes. The quantity and quality is good. They forgot to pack chutney for one of the thaalis, as we received only one portion of chutney. Otherwise, the paneer was tasty, the eggs very nicely prepared. The aloo bhaja sent by them is really less in quantity. Apart from that, 2 thalis is more than enough for 3 above average eaters!
P.S. the egg curry included in the thaali is same as egg bhuna.

Please do not order the korma. The notun rokomer dimer korma looks good but it's taste is extremely oily and wiered. The picture shows the amount of oil in the korma after the eggs are removed. Even the eggs tasted wierd. I wanted to give a 4 star rating but after tasting the kurma I had to change it. Please use less oil.",negative

I ordered two items.

✔ Starter: Kung-Pao fish-The fish was cooked to perfection and an amazing starter with very minimal amount of spices, chunks of bell pepper along with onions. I am still drooling over the tenderness of this dish. The addition of cashews added sweetness to it which was complementing the taste of the fish.

✔ Meal: Garlic Chicken and Veg-Fried Rice-Combo-This is one of my favourite combination. This duo comes with five pieces of succulent gravy chicken along with fried-rice which is fresh and not so oily. Therefore, contributing brilliantly to your appetite.

Their packaging is neat and spill-proof. The service is also quite prompt. Planning to order more from this joint soon.",positive

Ambiance was not good. It's a bar cum restaurant, people came with their kids and few guests were drunk at that time and giving slangs. Waiters were not co operative at all.

Had Basket Chilli Chicken in starters. It was really good. Then I had veg pulao, delhi butter murgh and mutton raara. Veg pulao was horrible,no taste at all. And the butter murgh was without butter. There was no taste of butter. Mutton rarra was full of fat, there was no meat. Not able to understand why they are charging 350 for butter chicken and 400 for mutton raara. It was just a waste of money. Above all they are charging 90 INR for 200ml sprite.

4)Chicken lasagne
The grilled chicken sizzler was amazing. The rice , the veggies and the chicken just melted in the mouth. It's a must try dish. One of the best sizzlers I ever had. The hot chocolate and the lasagne could be better. The hot chocolate was not too hot and tasted like bournvta. The lasagne was a tad bit too salty. The Mexican chicken was spicy just as we like it.

Opting for the Grill by the pool restaurant at Taj, instead of the coffee shop was a great decision. The restaurant can be enjoyed on a pleasant cool evening giving you a great experience by the pool. 

We ordered the steaks and asked for recommendations on what sauces accompany the dish best. The recommendations from our steward did not disappoint. Each steak was cooked perfectly to our preference, and the sauces and sides went beautifully with the main dish. 

I would recommend this restaurant to others who are looking for something more, and the ability to build your own dish with excellent sauces and choices.

Beverages: we ordered two Heineken

Food: we went with their classic Fire of Bengal pizza, which is a thin crust pizza covered with generous amount of mozzarella cheese , mutton keema and chilies. The pizza had a perfect balance of crispy and doughyness. It was topped with coriander leaves.

Everytime I have ordered from this place they never have minimals changes of ₹10 & ₹20 they expect to be paid ₹190 in full change and can’t even give a ₹10 change in return of ₹190. Secondly they always give the zomato valets the soiled torned notes or some coins. Sometimes it’s okay to accept the change as coins when it’s of a little amount but they gave ₹80 in full coins which is pathetic sometimes spoiled notes too. For the quality they provide food is over prices. Not at all happy though had tried different food items and gives enough chances but everything remains the same. Not ordering ever again.,negative

The waiters are not well trained or knowledgeable, but they are decently behaved. The quality of the chicken used was not good. Probably they used from previous day stock, so it hard and fibrous. The Teriyaki Sauce Chicken and the Dry Chilly Chicken both seemed slightly undercooked when we bit the chicken deep. Mixed Fried Rice was alright. Average food. Location is easily accessible from DH Road. Both Card and Cash option available.",negative

The pork was made of lean meat, was nicely tender and the fat was rendered very well but the taste of the chilli pork was really something that put me off , it was for some strange reason rather sweetish. I am not impressed.

Sorry but I cannot review on the ambience and the staffing as I ordered the food from this place today.
The taste was amazing. I had their Dal makhani and kashmiri aloo dum with Masala kulcha and Tandoori Roti.

7905,"It's been more than 3 years since I am visiting this hotel on an almost regular basis (once in 2 months most probably).
I would like to say, this restaurant has declined over the years. They have reduced the number of staff and only increasing the price. The service is very poor.

We had to wait for almost 20 mins. to get our food even when there were only 2 families present at that time (6 people total). They did not serve water also.

So, to sum it up, I would like to say that if you want to visit this restaurant for the first time..go for it..the food is extremely delicious though..but the poor service makes you so annoyed that you will not be able to enjoy it though.

VISIT IT ONE TIME AND SEE YOURSELF. YOU WILL SEE THE CHANGE",negative
11284,"Nu Wan Li is an authentic Chinese restaurant on Hazra Road, which is of two mins walking distance from Hazra Law College. The restaurant has a very homely feel and a traditional Chinese decor. The restaurant though not very big has sufficient seating arrangements. 

We ordered: 

1. Special Chow Mein Gravy: The Cantonese noodles were non-sticky and not over-boiled. The gravy was plain, simple, and full of flavours. There were plenty of vegetables in the dish apart from prawn, chicken and egg.
2. Clay Pot Prawn/ Mandarin style: This was the perfect accompaniment for the noodles. The sweet and tangy flavour of the Mandarin sauce was delicious. The prawns were big and juicy. The prawn did not lose its flavour when prepared in the sauce. Each bite was mouth-watering. 

A toothsome treat indeed. We enjoyed our lunch treat at Nu Wan Li, even though the price is a little on the higher side. The staff are very courteous and the service is prompt.

Currently they have The Great Indian Sizzler Festival going on and it's hard to pick a favorite from the diverse yet compact menu, but the hyderabadi Biryani sizzler is quite something!

As a vegetarian, I should be a little lenient on rating this one as the core competency would surely be in Non Vegetarian for this one. However, I will try.

AMBIENCE: Really good. Gives a vibe of a family restaurant with yellow lighting all over. You can feel that it's an Awadhi restaurant on entering this one.

FOOD: Ordered a Subz Biryani and Paalak ke Riashte for myself.
Quantity is really good for the price charged. Despite me being glutton, could not finish the whole Biryani. Maybe if I hadn't ordered the curry, I might have.
Coming to Paalak ke Rishte, it's a unique preparation with paneer stuffed in crushed spinach. Quite a different taste accompanied with the red tomato gravy. Can be tried once.
Dessert: Shahi Tukda. A little expensive, but ultimate quality.

The paratha was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The stuffing was absolutely delicious with the flavours being perfectly balanced. I would definitely like to try the other dishes from this place soon.

It was a pleasant experience to have it unless we spotted a dead insect in it. There were dead insect and hairs in the salad.

6371,"This place is allegedly known for its chaats and it does not, in any manner justifies the tag.
.
After being recommended, I went to this place in New Alipore all the way from Elgin Road Second to have its chaat. The menu is simply a basic Bhel Puri and mudi and nothing special.
.
It just serves normal and routine evening snacks with no exceptions at all, infact the menu here also does not have much to offer (3 to 4 items).
.
We decided to have bhel puri and rose soda. Surprisingly they add dhokla in their bhel puri which is kind of weird. And the rose soda was nothing but a rallys rose syrup and soda. Although the quantities of both the items were more than enough for two people, the taste does not leave a good impression.

If you travelling all the way to this place, his to eat bhel puri or mudi,......not recommend.",negative

Located: one can reach the place from the Hindustan park side or can come from the gariahaat-golpark side as well.

* Squid in butter Garlic gravy (the squid was a little rubbery which should not have been)
* Malabar paratha
* Pork Ghee roast (this one had too much of salt and so the owner was sweet enough to change)

It had peas, carrots and spring onions. Rice grains were long and was properly cooked. But something was missing as the taste was like normal rice or pulao.

Paper Chicken -

Chicken pcs were big and contained 4 pcs. The gravy was very simple (zero spice and less flavors) which seamed like soup. Chicken was hard which made chewing difficult.

Overall an OK experience and few improvements are required. It is budget restaurant with different cuisine options and reasonable price. Good place for quick lunch and dinner.",negative
3248,"This is a newly launched Bengali cuisine restaurant from the house of Baraanda, located near Patuli Floating Market, a 2 mins walking distance from Patuli police station stoppage. It is basically a takeaway and delivery joint but somehow it has managed a seating arrangement for 12 people. But this place has proved that ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". The place might be small but the foods here are exceptional. The variety is not huge but whatever it's offering is enough to make a Bengali soul happy.
We ordered:
Dhania Crushed Chicken Cutlet (120 Rs)
Basanti Pulao (60 Rs)
Mutton Dukbunglow (160 Rs)
But the place has not compromised with the food quality despite of its extreme reasonable prices.
Do visit or order from this place and have some delicious foods.",positive

But unfortunately because i reached after 7 pm, they were unable to serve dosas or uttapams, but fortunately they did serve me a plate of idlis. So that quenched my craving for south indian food a bit. But i was really hungry so almost reluctantly i had to order chole bhature. The chole lacked salt, i had to ask for more salt. But other than that the food was ok. We had also ordered lemon sodas which were mostly soda and sugar with a bit of lemon. I have had better lemon sodas, i'll be honest. I have visited ralli's before but yesterday's experience was not a very happy one.",negative

Chilly baby corn was good though but the Oreo shake was actually a waste of money. The only dessert I enjoyed was double scoop butterscotch ice cream.

But the wide variety of contents of the Thali scared us that we will not be able to finish it & the food will get wasted (also saw some co guests wasting their food in Thali). So we opted for à la carte. The tasty foods satisfy our taste buds. I must mention about the courteous staff. They were so gentle, friendly, patient & well mannered. We called one of the waiter for a number of times as we were confused whether to opt for Thali or à la carte, but he showed his level of patience & welcomed us every time with a smile. Looking forward to visit it again.

fresh lime soda- we had different choices fr the flavour and we were given as we hd wished for
crispy chicken- the quantity is what you will shocked at. this dish alone made us full.
the chicken threads were crispy and the taste was also good.
fish malai tikka- the pieces were so soft and juicy that it melted down as soon as we put it in my mouth! it was the star of the night.
cold coffee- amazing
we thought of having fried rice and a chinese chicken dish however the quantity of starters dint let us order that😂

Galauti Kebab Was Nice in Taste But the Lacha was a tad bit on the bigger size with the Kebab , A Slight Smaller Lacha Paratha Could Have Been Good May Be , But Over All Nice.. Kebabs Shape Could have been better though ,
The Disappointment Was Dal Makhni , It was a total disaster , The Makhni Way too Many Floating On The Dal , It Had Ginger Julians Quite Big in size also the dal didnt melt properly neither did it have the proper thick consistency and it tasted bit tangy and sweet..

They served a really big tangy mocktail which I absolutely loved, then for starters they served two chicken legs with a sweet sauce and mouth-watering chilly potatoes with sesame seeds, the chicken legs were extremely crisp and yum. For main course they served chilly fish and fried rice and let me tell you it was the best chilly fish I tasted till now.
For dessert they served a tutti fruity shot which was really small but quite tasty.

The preparation was really praiseworthy. Staffs were pretty attentive and amiable. It's a superb night! And I think this is going to be a place for often arrival to me. But the only problem would be parking issues. Anyway, see you soon!",positive
4632,The place is a little far away from Kolkata but the food is definitely worth the travel. They serve a HUGE variety of dosas and other south Indian food which are great in both quality and quantity. The atmosphere is also really clean and hygenic. Definitely worth a visit.,positive
7051,"So if you are having a corporate busy life in sector 5 then you can go to this place at the end of your office...
This place serves delicious food items and their bar menu also as good as food menu..
Price is also reasonable..
It is located near weble house ( a 10 mins walking distance from weble more).

So we oderd some different kind of kebabs and alcohol..
With some Indian Main Course...

The ambience is also good..
And behavior of workers are also good.",positive

1609,Park Street is well known for restaurants bars trincas is one of the oldest bar come restaurants in that area and for anybody who loves food with music will love this place I have been there on a date and I totally loved the Ambience the food was really good but it is pricey but I am not complaining because the live music is something that made my evening better.,positive
8858,"Visited this purely on experimental instincts.
On entering this place, all one can hear is the sound of cheap loud music banging on one's ears. There is literally nothing like an ambience, just mere seating arrangements and low lighting.

Everything could be excusable if it lived solely to the name of even being a Hookah place. The Hookah served here was neither fascinating nor well made but was rather choking. It was far overpriced above it's standards and hardly any joy. The service was extremely slow and inefficient and the annoying music added up to making conversations harder.

The crowd swayed up to it, therefore not an ideal place for people seeking quality time.",negative

I was quite unsure about the food's quality after reading so many mixed reviews. I tasted the food as soon as it arrived. The rice was pretty well cooked and the flavours were good. Three large pieces of chicken, 2 eggs and 2 big potato pieces were just more than enough for the money spent. But the chicken wasn't soft at all. It didn't have any moisture, which indicated that it wasn't marinated well. Overall, the experience was not bad, but the quality is not suitable for the original cost.",negative

It was nice and cozy and lights were low creating a great ambience.
It was located inside a road and easily locatable,
Staff were very generous and helpful.

🔹Dry chilly chicken- it was topped with minced green chillies and tastes good
🔹Veg Wanton- it was nice and crispy stuffed with cabbage and veggies in it
◾️Main Course
🔹Veg Fried Rice- it was normal but full of spices, and any spicy lover would loved it
🔹Egg and Chicken Fried Rice- it tastes good and had a lot of meats in it
🔹Chilly Chicken- it was normal and I don't like it much
🔹Chicken Schezwan- I loved this particular dish a lot and the gravy was awesome to go with rice.

11033,"This is a small but efficient fast food joint located not exactly near the new market but on Motisil St. which connects Lenin Sarani to S. N. Banerjee Rd (Regal Theatre).

The name suggests it to be a Punjabi/North Indian fast food joint but it isn't. In fact, they mainly have Rolls and Chinese menu on offer. I've always loved rolls in this area and this particular stall offers some great ones. Apart from it, rest of the items tastes good too. It's completely pocket friendly and two people can fill themselves up in around Rs 250-300 max. They don't have any covered seating arrangements and basically a take away sort of a counter. One can order and just sit on the one or two available chairs, that's all.

I'm surprised not to see a single review about this outlet. Let me open the book with mine.",negative

We ordered Steamed rice, Moong dal, alu bhaja, kochupata diye chingri bhapa, bhetki paturi, both chicken and mutton duckbanglow, chatni and mishti doi. The service was quick as the food came very fast. The dal and the bhaja tasted good but the quantity was not sufficient. The chingri tasted very good, the paturi was also good. In the mutton duckbanglow, the pieces were a totally loss as they were full of bones and hardly had any meat in it. It should have been cooked more. The pricing here is also pretty high.

2849,"Dark and cozy place to hangout, nice ambiance but unfortunately no dance floor neither greatly appreciated for music played over there.

But the starters are good to taste. Green Chili Chicken was superb, fish finger was so so, fish taste could have been better but the Cajun spicy chicken was spicy and different in taste. I clearly recommend green chili chicken and Cajun spiced chicken. The grilled chicken with pepper sauce was not at all upto the mark, mashed potato was sweet in taste, chicken steak was hard to chew and the sauce also not good enough to make you please.

Most of the beer was not available as a form of tower on tuborg and kingfisher.

High mid range pub good food, mid range liquor, but they definitely need to improve in music to catch the mood of the crowd.

Definitely I will visit again.

Lots of memories are attached with this place so still love it. One of my favourite dish is chowmin , quantity is easily be shared by 2. You can also try their special fish Kobiraji. One of the best kobiraji u can find under this roof. They serve special kobiraji with a thick tasty gravy with a sunny side up egg. Try their moghlai.

But,

Ambience is slightly shabby, not well lit area, and they have an amazing collection of all the cameras that have been used for film/serial direction of the past decades and posters of several hit films of movie industry worldwide pasted on the wall but the arrangements of the decor gave out a very chaotic vibe in general, failing to make a decent effort of sticking to a themed restaurant decor.

It is located near the Patuli Police station area and is easily available on the Google Maps.
The restaurant is decorated totally like an authentic Bengali style with Classic Bengali songs playing in the background makes the ambience feels like home. The restaurant is simply lit with minimum highlighted lights on the wall makes them bring a special retro look.
The food is amazing specially the Kochu Chingri was best in class. Moreover the luchi and the alur dom with narkel chingri is a must try there.

We had ordered a regular Breakfast(no-veg), a non-veg sandwich and Chicken Pizza.

Sandwich was so no sandwich, it was like the worst sandwich. Coming to the Pizza, they should be banned for baking such disastrous pizza's.
The base of the pizza was just Yuck, so bad, the pizza sauce had no taste, and the Cheese quality was just simply sad. I don't even get, how someone can suck up making a pizza in so many levels, kudos for that!

We ordered a chicken pasta which was too spicy and didn't taste that good either",negative

Heard so much about this place from all my friends thought of trying this one. Went there with my buddy for our Sunday adda session. The nice courteous staff combined with some lively music and cute decor is sure enough to enliven your spirits while you enjoy the lip-smacking food.

What we had -

*Brownie Shake
*KitKat Shake
*Chitpole Bbq Wings Sizzler
*Chicken Steak Sizzler

I highly recommend both the shakes. The right amount of cream, brownies and ice cream will make you crave for more. Coming to the sizzlers, I absolutely loved the Chitpole Bbq Wings Sizzler. If you love spicy chicken wings tossed with bbq and chitpole sauce, then this one is sure to blow your mind. The Chicken Steak Sizzler was also good. 

Will try their famous breakfast platter and caesar salad on our next visit and update the review soon.
Till then, Happy Gorging! :)

7514,"People who judge the outlet for it's ambience, let me tell you this was how eateries of Calcutta (before it became Kolkata) used to be. If you love check-ins more than food then surely this is not a place for you. You might not feel that the place is perfect for your selfie. Walls are not properly decorated and no attention is provided to lighting as well.

Then why should you visit this small outlet??

This place is for people who love FOOD more than anything else, and when it comes to good and affordable food the outlet is second to none. Be it hygiene or taste it's a sure 5/5. More than that the place is easily locatable and has a very friendly and welcoming staff. Every item here is nice though the Fish Kabiraji is something you should not miss.",positive

⚫️ Murgh Butter Masala - 3/5

And from what I can say this place serves food that's a total bang for the buck. The taste was above average. I felt they should have incorporated more flavor to the noodles. But the quantity, man oh man the amount of chicken they added with the big heap of rice noodles is a big win-win for the both of us. The chicken was tasty, the vegetables were fresh (well, kind of) but the quality of the chili sauce could be better. All in all I won't say that I'm not satisfied.

Creamy penne with oodles of cheesy sauce and chicken. The quantity was very fulfilling. Eat a spoonful to experience foodgasm at its best.

Baked Chicken Parmigiana:
Baked chicken breast on a bed of spaghetti tossed in tangy sauce and cheese.

Chicken lasagna:
It was a blend of cheese, tomato sauces and chicken, full of flavours served warm and cheesy.

6466,"Edit: I don't know what happened overnight, but within a day they have increased their price more than double! Absolutely not worth the price anymore. I sure would not eat Veg Noodles from a roadside shack for 90 per plate. The same order today costs 430. This must be some kind of joke.

Ordered Veg Hakka Noodles last night along with a plate of Chilly Chicken. I must say I am happy with the overall quantity of both the items, however I didn't like the taste of the Veg Hakka at all. It was over cooked and almost felt like I cooked it myself, and I can't cook at all. But the Chilli Chicken was love. It was very good and they gave 8 boneless pieces which was again a plus, and for ₹230, we had a lovely dinner.
But one thing that particularly bothered me was that the Chilly Chicken was packed in a container belonging to some othet restaurant in Garia. I was kinda surprised and I am wondering if they buy used utensils from Garbage Collectors, ignoring thr basic hygiene criteria...",negative

Services were good, staffs are polite...

Food : I ordered for a plate of Special Chicken Chowmein and Dry Chilly Chicken.

If you are here for alcohol then I would personally recommend not to drink it here as they aren't serving the actual drinks. They are diluting it with other liquids. Food was really nice.

Well, Being a street food parlour you won't find good seating area but just a very basic one where you must hold your plates in hands. But I repeat don't let the seating area fool you. The food is quite good. We ordered Chicken stew with bread and tea. The chicken used was very fresh and it tasted good. The stew too tasted great and had all the right ingredients in right amount. The tea too tasted great. We had 3 chicken stew with bread and 3 teas which cost us a mere 250 bucks which I suggest is very cheap if you consider the quality of the food.

now coming to their services:

food quality n quantity: both were good. just slightly above average.

service: prompt. but u can't find suited waiters here so if u r looking for something fancy, don't visit this place. the waiters r young lads who are still naive n you might face communication or language issue, but you ll get whatever you want.

interior: as i said, nothing fancy.

we ordered chicken fried rice n kung pao chicken..n as we are accustomed with 'Indian-Chinese', the taste of kung pao may disappointing. they do not have anything in 4-6 pieces, all r served in 8 or 10 pieces.

There's nothing to say much, if u r a foody n happy with good food, u may give a try. This place is certainly not for dates. n they are quite pocket friendly too.. ciao ciao.",positive

For food, we had ordered ""Tripple Schezwan"" which was basically rice and noodles cooked together. It was good in taste.

For drinks, we went for their signature drink ""Bubble Mojito"" and ""Brownie Shake"". Both were good but I liked their brownie shake more since it literally had brownie crumps all throughout the drink, unlike other cafes.

The dish was a tad salty for my palette but the momos had sumptuous and tasty fillings and the pan sauce had a punch regarding its heat.

11227,"This is a new name in the field of burgers. A man selling burger on a bike and hence the name burger bike. There is nothing special about the burger and it is not good even. The patty of the burger is the worst part of it as it's not cooked up to the mark and also the contents of the Patty have no taste. All the contents of the burger are present like lettuce , mayo, ketchup, tomato etc but it's not worth to spend 50 bucks on this. It's much better when you make at home. One would imagine that the menu is small and hence the quality should be good but unfortunately it's not so. This joint needs a lot of improvement....",negative
5412,"It is located on feeder road, on ground floor of Bandhan Bank (belgharia). Recently, I have went there to have biriyani with my friend.

The veg pakora was basically an assortment of pakoras..while one was paneer, one was gobi, one cheese, one mushroom.. very odd!!!
Not a nice experience.",negative

That's a big letdown. 70% dishes on the menu were not available. Expected so much more from this one. We ordered Golden Fried Prawn, Shriracha Chicken Wings, Burnt Garlic Fried Rice and Double Fried Pork. The taste of Shiracha wings was okayish. Felt a little stale and smelly. Golden Fried prawns were double battered and over thick. Fried Pork was good. The Burnt Garlic Fried Rice tasted just basic. Not upto the mark.",negative
13,"This is one of those classic restaurants in Park Street,you have to visit once if you're in Calcutta!Been there countless times,and no visit to Peter Cat would be complete without the customary signature dish,Chelo Kebab (Talking about the Chelo,it's one of it's kind in Peter Cat; i've tried the ripoffs in other restaurants but none matched the taste buds titillating capacity of Peter Cat's version)Other notable mentions would be the Bhetki/Chicken meuniere,served on Banana leaves with the lip smacking white sauce.If there's room in your tummy for more,the Mutton Dum Kiraan with naan is something you should definitely try . All this go hand in hand with the quirky named cocktails.I would have to say there's room for improvement in the dessert section and getting a table here on a busy evening is a special feat. If they would only allow advance reservations!All in all i would never give anything below 5 to Peter Cat,hope they maintain their standards through the years to come.",positive

The two main things which they sell most are chicken biryani and chaanp that are edible but compromise on quality, hygiene, taste and if you ever find hair strands in either biryani or chaanp or both, they won't take much effort or trouble to apologize or change it but simply dip their finger and take it out with a smile.

Ordered fish finger, egg chicken roll, chicken roll with chicken kebab and chicken pakora. The fish fingers were stuffed with fish and it was so crispy. They served it with fries and kasundi. The egg chicken roll was sumptous and it actually works as a wholesome snack that you can skip your dinner. The chicken roll with chicken kebab was pretty good as well. The chicken pakoras were tasty but I would have been happier if there had been a bit more of chicken.
The Fish Fingers are a must try. Truly a show stealer.",positive

6871,"Baan Thai has always been a very popular upscale Thai restaurant for the crowd of Calcutta. I have a fondness for Thai cuisine and believe that 5 star hotel Restaurants make the best Thai food. The decor is very classy and something that you would find in a 5 star hotel.
Though I enjoyed my meal I personally feel that its very usual and nothing extra ordinary,even the menu is very basic nothing that stands out.

What I ordered:

-Warm Asparagus Salad : I like a little bit of crunch in the asparagus which was missing but the flavor was good

-Phad Thai : very well made. Sure the seafood Phad Thai would be excellent too

-Vegetables in Ginger Garlic sauce : the mushroom used was excellent and the sauce was made phenomenally.

The service is of high standards although a very fast movement of waiters disturbs the diners and I saw some very casually dressed diners in a fine dining restaurant and I think they should stick to a dress code.",positive

10884,"A few days ago I would have had good things to say about this place but I guess good momos are not the only thing that makes an eatery worth visting more than once. We are used to ordering momos from this place since the price is reasonable and the food is not altogether inedible. We ordered 3 plates of steam momo and waited for one and half hours for the delivery to arrive. After a long wait we decided to call them up and all we get is "" we forgot to process the order"". 
I guess the staff could not care less about the regular customers. There was no hint of regret  in the staff member's voice and no urgency to undo the mistake. 
Service and quality of food speaks on behalf of the eatery. I hope they will remember to provide the food and the services to the next customer :)

The place is quite old it will surely make one travel back to the old days. You have two options available either you sit on the mat layed on the ground or the usual table chair room. They ask you whether u would like Ur food served on a banana leaf or a plate. And the plate is a huge heavy brass plate. Eating here is a one of a kind experience food is extremely tasty and they are quite famous also in the locality. If you are carving for mutton and are planning to visit here then u must be early coz it is there best seller and it gets sold out very quickly. They serve a variety of fishes , chicken and prawns also.
I had the prawn along with rice and mashed potatoes (Allu chokha). Everything was just yum and out of the world. I paid 175 rs for my lunch and was left highly satisfied.

Went to the washroom to wash my hands the basin was overflowing with water and no place to wash hands. No one was there but the tap was on overflowing the basin with dirty water.The water had pieces of small soap floating in it.

The commode was overloaded with human faeces . After seeing all that what I ate was about to come out. Same was the condition at the gents toilet as reported by a friend of mine rather condition was worser in the gents toilet as reported by him.

Coming on to the food, I absolutely loved the sizzlers.
The Rajma Chawal Sizzler was one of its kind, with very good balance of spices.
The Kung Pao Sizzler was amazing as well, i loved the tangy taste of it.
The next mention would be Mustard Paneer Chilli Sizzler. Well, its made of mustard sauce or ""kasundi"" with a well mix of the flavours.

I’ve been here twice. First experience was with Tandoori Roti & Kulcha alongside Chicken & Mutton items which were worthy and put everything consolidated, this joint would walk away with easy 4. But the problem arose when I ordered Biryani in my 2nd visit. It was worthless. No wonder they offer complimentary soft drinks with their Biryanis probably to gulp down the worthless piece of meat & rice. Pricing is very competitive & it’s worthy of the food & service they serve. Recommendation: Yes, but don’t order Biryani 😉",negative

It was a very pleasing experience. Good Food, Good laughs and Good friends. I was content, I was satisfied, I was happy.

I have been to many buffet outlet and often to Barbeque but I must say this has been my best buffet experience.

In starters, I enjoyed items of fish, prawn, chicken, mutton, paneer, Broccoli, Cauliflower etc.

The Best thing was unlimited pepsi glass for Rs. 50. Just for Rs. 50 I can have any number of glass of pespi. This was an offer hard to miss.

Desserts were as usual.

As compared to Barbeque it does miss pan, kulfi and a few other items. But, I would still rate it higher because food seemed fresh and rightly cooked unlike being roasted over and over again.

7335,"● Location: Chowringhee 
● Type: Online delivery
● Cuisine: Chinese, Asian, Thai

While scouting for new restaurants to order a side dish for dinner, ""Cloud kitchen"" was on the top 5 highly rated list. We decided to buy a fish main-course to enjoy with our pre-cooked steamed rice and Aloo ki Sabji for dinner. We ordered:

1. Chilli Garlic fish: Boneless pieces of fish, batter-fried and cooked in a spicy- sweet and sour sauce. The fish portions were soft and juicy. The softness of the fish along with its hot and tangy flavours triggered our taste buds. The sauce was neither too spicy nor too sweet. We will try their other Chinese, Thai and Asian preparations sometime soon. This restaurant is definitely worth a try.

10863,"The ratings of 2.9 on Zomato for this particular eatery might incite varied thoughts in the minds of Zomato users but the perspective should be very clear on what points a user rates.

Surely, this is not a premium range Chinese eatery and it is absolutely baseless to expect such taste or hospitality out here. However, one should keep in mind that, it is obviously better than the roadside vendor serving you his own recipe in the name of Chinese. Furthermore, you get to eat your food being seated which should be considered too.

The taste of the Chinese provided here is not a great one nor can it be termed tasteless. The behaviour of the staffs are okayish and it is a place for people expecting to have food to fill their stomach not their essence. It is generally filled with people of teenage to adult age group. The price they charge for the food they provide should be termed ""moderate""; but, it is actually an eatery for cheap food.

1. Prawn Magic Funny Fry which was crispy coated with corm flakes.
2. Chicken Khichuri- Served with generous dollops of ghee and a chicken leg piece was yumm.
3. Mutton Pollanno- This resembles a Biriyani but has a subtle taste which I really loved.
4. Baked Bhetki Cheese Patishapta- The showstopper of the day. They have numerous Patishaptas to choose from, but this one is highly recommended.
5. Gondhoraaj Chicken with Ghee Paratha- This was not so great as I expected a strong flavor of the Gondhoraaj lemon, but it lacked that. Paratha was big in size and tasted good

5. Baked Patishapta for dessert- This was extremely delicious and you must end your meal with this if you have a sweet tooth. Will surely revisit.",positive

:
Ordered Afgani Pomfret and Mutton Rogini, and here are my takes on the both.

While the Afgani Pomfret was good size wise, it needed to be roasted more! It was kinda raw and lacked the correct amount of spices! 
Plus the packing was awful! The fish broke in the event of getting delivered!

:
Again with the mutton, it tasted nice! Literally nice. But they are giving you 4pieces for just 260/- odd!
Result ? Pathetic pieces! Small and all the fat content. I had just one proper piece with meat, rest 3 had to be dumped because they were nothing but fat!!

Wide range of appetizers to begin with, continuing to over 20 dishes for main course and the best part? For the dessert lovers and the sweet toothed folks, you can sort your cravings with almost as many as 40 different dessert items to choose from within their collections! 

Additionally, Marriott boosts it up with their live counters serving different items each day. Truly a great place for any meal of the day.",positive

4886,"Ordered their Chicken Shawarma Salad through Zomato. Delivery time was on point with good packaging. The delivery person even considered the fact that I had put down my address wrongly mentioning my home address and not the office one and agreed to make a change. So pretty impressed with service. Coming back to food, salad was really tasty with the lettuce, olives, chicken, cabbage dripped in dressing complimented by soft Pita Breads. Quantity is enough for 2 people looking for light snacking and not ready to kill for food. But the mayo content is very high in dressing instead of hummus that is usually served in Shawarma. Looking over the Indian twist on the ""authentic"" Lebanese dressing it was a pleasant experience. Looking forward to trying more of their dishes.",positive

However, the view was great. And they had an event coming up.. For which we couldnt stay for long .
Anyway, as far as the food was concerned, tastes were great! We had pasta in mixed sauce, and creamy spinach stuffed grilled chicken , and bromelia bubbles. All of them tasted great, especially the sizzler.
We also tried the seesha which was great as well.
Would love to visit this place for a longer period someday 😊",positive

The gravy was very tempting to look but lacked the punch which is the hallmark of of this signature chicken dish. Moreover, excessive use of red dried chilli made the item very hot and due to that whatever taste was left of the gravy had disappeared. In future the restaurant should be more careful about the portion they serve. Such small pieces of chicken against a high
price tag is a total waste of money on a Sunday morning.",negative

But the staff promptly replaced all our bowls on request. The soup was very good and light. Then came the panner Tikka starter. It was Soo good that we had to get a second helping. That made up for every little flaw which we experienced in the beginning.

Then comes the food. Even though the buffet was not very elaborate, the limited items they had all tasted good. The mix vegetables to the kulchas and the rice.

It took them another 20 minutes to serve a cheesecake which was absolutely stale and stinking. I even tried to cut a slice but the texture felt different. Only a person who has lost his sense of smell can present this in front of a patron.

22 chicken tandoori styled pieces, in a sour sauce made of curt and whole spices, at a price less than ₹250.

How does it taste?
Up to the mark I'll say.
The pieces are small but, yes, the chicken fibres are soft and the masalas are incorporated perfectly to each part.

A way too sour in my opinion.
Checking on the ingredients can improve the overall composition.

Small cozy place to hop in...good ambience at a pleasing location near desopriyo park ..

3152,"Well well well we are getting more reluctant on ordering food online and we are somewhere enjoying it as well as we are getting it without any hardships. But what happens when you wait for 40 mins for your order and the order comes wrong. The disaster happened to me last week when i ordered food from here via a Food Delivery App. My order was Prawn Chow and Egg Chow and they sent me Egg Chow and Veg Sechzwan Chow. I mean Seriously where is my prawn? Dont they even read the order correctly, Who ever is accepting the order there should buck himself up because this is not a very ordinary mistake. 
I had to rate 3 because i cant give 2.5 and just to justify the 2.5 is the quantity they provided, One Chow in that price is very sufficient for two person.

But a major downpoint according to me is the price of alcohol. It High. And i was very disappointed considering there are places where the same alcohol is served at low rates.
If i would have known before, wouldn't have gone there for alcohol or shisha.

Plus, they ask you to be a member by paying ₹100 and when asked what are the benefits, they say nothing as of now. Then how can you ask someone to pay and be a member when there is no benefit available.

Was waiting to Go to this place but turned out be sheer disappointment.

Please look into it.",negative

Rating: 4/5

Location:Salt lake FD block sector 3

Cuisine: Rajasthani (strictly vegetarian)

Pocket pinch: 600 for two.

Ambience: Beautiful ambience with a rustic taste.The earthen utensils did justice to the ambience...with soft music from old Hindi songs adding flavour to the ambience.

What we ordered: special bati chokha and Alu paratha along with a Pepsi.

Special Bati chokha: two pieces bati (one panner and one sattu),dal,rice,chokha, ghee,chutney,pickle,kheer served in clay pots

Taste: Bati chokha was served hot and was appealing to the tastebuds.The ghee was acting like catalyst to enhance the taste.Dal was excellent.We found the paratha very soft n was well stuffed but a bit bland.",positive

The ambience is also pretty basic, nothing to get you pampered. Having said that, they offer both north Indian and Chinese cuisines, as well as basic fast foods like rolls and all. I have been to this joint once and after tasting their food I was completely surprised. Considering their shabby and dull set up, I was really not expecting their dishes to be so exquisite and perfect. The quantities served was also abundant. The staffs were very courteous and helpful, the service was pretty smooth and the prices are not than reasonable. So if your criteria is to enjoy good quality food in reasonable price and if the ambience and decor doesn't matter to you then this is a perfect place for you.",negative

This place's chef has the perfect magic in his hand. On the day of our colleague's bornday celebration we have ordered food from this place for the first time.

We had ordered:

1. Tandoori Roti - This roti had made with wheat, From my side it was a bit hard but my colleagues said that was good.

2. Dal Makhani - This was awesome, that was thick and fulfilled my expectations.

3. Vegetable Jhalfrezi - This item was also very good. Made with capsicum, pointed guard, and it was loaded with whole kernel corn.

But if sometime I just want to take out some friend with me and try something exclusive I use zomato gold and they offer 2+2 on drinks. That means you get 2 drinks complimentary. And also to mention that they refill the munchies for the drinks every time we want.
Service is fast for food and drinks. I have tried their biriyani. It is really very very light. Someone in the mood for a biriyani might not like it. Have tried their reshmi kebab which is good. Their chicken barbeque drumsticks is very good and I have it almost every time I visit. It's a bar so we should not expect any high class ambience.

The people tending to the diners do not heed to the customer’s wishes. We tried to negotiate with the management about the seating since we were a big group of 12. They were seating 6 of us in one corner and the others in the far end of the other. They were simply not adjusting and ill-treated us all who tried to talk sense into them. They themselves did not adjust but when we tried to adjust ourselves, they were all the more pushing us to go out.

They kept telling us again and again “Olypub is open.” My question to the management- Are you the personal propaganda partner of Olypub?

Our only fault- we wanted to sit close together so that we could all talk while having dinner.

We ordered drinks and chicken, pork, rice/chowmein, crispy chicken, fried fish fingers. The food was okay though.

The rating I gave is only for the food and overall VERY VERY disappointed with the experience.",negative

Some dishes like Chicken Butter masala,Chana masala,Chicken Do Piyaza are my all time favorites.Another mind blowing bread comes from their oven is the fantastic Aloo Paratha in the cold winter mornings,which warms up instantly as it melts in mouth.
A joint having their looks,foods and obvious swagger is bound to satisfy one's tummy.",negative

It may not be famous as they are not so popular in zomato but I will recommend those persons who loves some old age things with affordable price and to spend their evening calmly.

Not for those who loves modern decor... !!

Pan cake is a must try item amongst all... Chaa er sathe adda tar sathe pan cake ta .. Sundor jome kaka... !!😊

Sizzlers-
Prawn Sizzler
Chicken Sizzler
Pork sizzler
Mixed veg sizzler
The quantity was generous and the i really have to say that it was glazed to perfection and sizzled to taste!

Baos-
Prawn bao
Chicken bao
Veg bao
The baos were soft and fluffy and was presented in a completely different way.

We also had some items from their a la carte menu-
Pan fried noodles
Hakka fish
Thai fried rice
Five spice chicken

However I wouldn’t recommend this). For the kid in our group we ordered the chicken Penne Arrabiato Pasta which was good.

Quantity is remarkably good,quality is not bad.
Can't demand authentic spices in kebabs or authentic crispness in fried chicken at such low prices,but its good enough.

It has got closed and open areas. In the open area, there is a cabana style seating arrangement which will give you your own space. It can accommodate 5 people per cabana. And there's three cabanas and a high table in the centre of the open area.

My review for what we ordered.

Orange Galaangal - well prepared Mojito.
Fusion - Good Mojito with a tinge of strawberry.
French Fries with Cheese - it's just simple fries with cheesy dip. The name is quite deceptive. This is the only dish which disappointed me. The salt content was also quite high.
Pizza - You can choose 4 toppings to make your custom pizza. It was a crispy thin crust pizza.

The price range is similar to other cafes. It also has North Indian options if you want to have the same.

A must visit for everyone.",positive

I had the opportunity to visit them during my short stay at Kolkata. The food is absolutely at par with places like Hole In The Wall in Bangalore or Pasha in The Park Chennai. 

I tried the potato fries and the Oink burger! Trust me I have never had fries like that before. Texture and quality wise they scored pretty high. 

Quantity wise, I could clearly see them maintaining a standard and at par with any bigger brand out there. 

Pricing is surprisingly on a wee lower side. Easily a difference of 10% from the regular brands. 

Presentation is great and they pulled it out in a record 12-15 mins which is exemplary.

Excellent hospitality and I wish the team led by Atrei (Founder) wonderful days ahead! This place should be on your watchlist if you are in Kolkata and especially Salt Lake.

8340,"Bangaliana-themed as it is, this place has interiors with high level of creativity.
We ordered:
•Pasta in Pesto Cream:
It was well prepared. The pesto sauce wasn't very strong and the seasoning was just right.
•Bhetki Sizzler:
This had many elements in it. It was having a well cooked piece of bhetki in a unique tasting sauce. It was quite impressive on the whole.
•Mint Oreo Shake:
This was more of a chocolate Oreo Shake so I was a little disappointed not to find the exact mint flavour.
Service was moderately okay.

It's good for health thought taste wise not that popular choice I presume. Specially amongst sweet toothed Bengali people. 😁 But as I said it's a great drink to get hydrated specially after working out.
Next time will try fresh fruit smoothies.

Chicken Angara Kebab : 6 pieces of soft chicken with lot of Spices and Black Pepper... ♨️

Mutton Biriyani : Always been the benchmark setter whenever you visit a mughlai resturant.. Now it actually got a good grade for it.. Mutton and Rice portion were tasty but I found the aloo little blunt.

Firni : It was awesome.. ❤️

Pocket Pinch Rs. 905(including GST) for 3 people.. But they didn't serve regular water rather serve a bottle of 1 litre Kinley and include the price of it in the bill.. Recommended.

The kitchen here can proudly stand at par with some of the best food I’ve tasted all over the world. The quality is impeccable and it’s honestly the little touches that really elevates Salt House for me - the malt vinegar that is served with the battered fish and chips, the fact that they serve cottons ginger ale, the home made garlic bread that is served with a luxuriously scented prawn dish to mop up that sauce and the attentive service. Beyond the quality, it’s the vision and the synergy that the food has with Bengal - No other restaurant in the city showcases our amazing flavours such as gondhoraj, kasundi and kolmi saag. 
I would dare to say that this is the best modern and relevant dining experience in the city. A true joy.",positive

Loved the KitKat Shake.
Blueberry shake was something which I tried for the first time,was okayish.

Between the Freak Shakes liked the Choco Overload freakshake, Strawberry Monster was good.

Red Melon and Green Apple Mojitos were quite good and refreshing and looked beautiful with fruit bubble pearls in it.

•Fish Fillets
•Chicken Fingers
•Chicken Nuggets

I will recommend to every one to order from this shop the chicken is absolutely halal. And super fast delivery orders. The shop owner behaviour is so cool.

The ac was put on 30 and it was just not comfortable. Even after telling them to reduce the temperature, there was no noticeable change.

Coming to food, we ordered:

⏺️Egg fried rice: decent in taste.
⏺️ Vegetable noodles: average.
⏺️Boneless chilli chicken: again, decent.
⏺️Garlic chicken: to my horror, it was sweet.
⏺️Mixed rice: tasted fine.
⏺️Chilli pork: my friends had it and they were satisfied but mentioned that the meat was stiff.
⏺️Fresh lime soda: usual.

I have had in better places in terms of ambience and food which has the same pocket pinch. Honestly, I was too hungry to judge so I finished my food.

The food is amazing though they only serve vegan food but is still amazing in its category. The Virgin Mojito, Mavericks style chat and Paneer Saslik is a must try there. The best thing that they offer is Chocolate Fondant, a kind of desert. This tastes perfect. It's a must try !

We ordered Rava masala Dosa, cheese butter masala Dosa, dahi bade, idli sambhar and Mysore masala Dosa. Dahi bade was nice ,cheese butter masala Dosa was crispy and tasty.

Raita served along was watery with no thickness. Atleast use some curd and less water in the raita henceforth.
Mutton chaap was okayish in taste.
The fish kebab was raw and wasn't cooked properly.
Only thing that was good was the ambience.
Being a food blogger I have never visited such a bad place with this good rating!

573,"If you are searching for a perfect Bengali cuisine, this is a gem of a place for that. You can choose from a variety of items, and trust me, each of them are equally amazing ! We went for the buffet and I am very much impressed by it. The picture of the items in buffet is provided here. The fish fry was perfect. Simply perfect. Chanar kofta, and chingri malai curry and paanch foron murgi were perfectly upto the mark. Alongwith the dessert in the buffet, we also order nolen gurer icecream ( simply tastes heaven ) and baked sondesh. The aam porar shorbot was so-so. This really disappointed me after having such a great lunch. It was very much plain. They can probably work on it a bit more. Worth a try.",positive
10534,"Ordered octopus steam momo, according to price its okay,,,but packaging was not upto the mark, and the taste of the is very very average, Because when i eating the momos there was no special taste of octopus, the qantity of the vegetables were extra i just got the flavours of carrots and onion.. Otherwise it was not okay,,
Suggestions : try add little bttr wo tht flavours can enhance,
Try not to choped the octopus bcz when customers order they will definitely want to fll the pice of octopus,

And the color of the momo was red,so i dont inow it was natural color or the food color...

Keep it up guys... I really like the menu. And 1more thing there was no role of the green chutny, and the green chutny was not at all tste good,there is lack of salt and the flavours,, but i like the taste of peanut..",negative
6732,"The menu needs to be updated because I was charged a bit more than what is mentioned here. Tried their non veg combo. The veg combo mentioned here wasn't even there on their Menu Card which they handed me. The Litchi Iced tea and Chocolate Tart were great, although I didn't find anything of substance in the non veg sandwich. Its pretty much the one you can make at home, minus the chicken. (I hope you know what that means). A cozy place to hang out. The decor is okay. The staff was friendly.
FREE ADVICE:---The pizza is a really small one, the size of a normal piece of bread. Don't waste your money on that or the momo, which you can get for a lot cheaper at Wow Momo(and with a lot more flavour, which goes without saying).",negative
2964,"This place specializes in different potato items. We tried their potato twistato and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. The service is little slow but the staffs are very cordial.

We ordered:
☑️Masala or Tandoori Twistato ( I don't recollect which one it was exactly.)
☑️ Peri Peri Twistato

The peri peri twistato was very tasty and was worth the penny. But the other one didn't taste good.
The prices here are light on the pocket but as of the twistato it is slightly overpriced. You can give it a try if you want to taste something new and different. Overall, the place is quite likeable.",positive

Keeping a tag of Pet Friendly does not justify your love towards pets and their explanation was that they allow small breeds. So my question is...what would you do if your kids get obsess. Won't you take him/her along.
If you have such a narrow minded specifications, kindly remove Pet Friendly tag asap, which is misleading us.",negative

Coming to the food, I was their with 3 of my friends and ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Manchurian, Hot Garlic Chicken and Fried Chicken Momo. The rice was good, the chicken dishes was okaish as both the dishes tasted exactly the same but still it was tasty and the momo was good too but it was too much oily.

All in all this place is good. The prices are not very expensive but not very cheap as well. The pricing is fine but the quantity is less. And the service is slow. When we ordered they said that we have to wait for sometime. So apart from these two reasons the rest is good.",positive

I had ordered a combo which is called Mutton Biryani + Gulshan Er Chicken Chanp to kill my hunger at my work place which is just in a few steps away from this restaurant. And they have completely fulfilled my expectations. In the combo they are serving - 1 Portion Biryani Rice, 1 Mutton Piece, 1 Leg Piece Chicken in Chanp & Salad. As per the portion I must say that is not quite good, I guess I have ordered Combo so that they have given a less quantity. But if I review it for the taste of food it's really wonderful, and I fall in love with the Chicken Chanp, thank you chef for that lovely dish. I have recommended it to my colleagues too.

Egg Biryani @ Rs. 60 (2.5/5) :

Recently ordered Egg Biryani from here, delivered hot in a paper box by Zomato on right time. Biryani rice seemed okey but not well mixed with spices and that didn't made it packed full of flavours. Potato piece seemed double cooked and became black while boiled egg was okey. Quantity was okey too. Overall it tasted very average.

Their Biryani wasn't as good as other delivery restaurants like Zoya. But at this cheap price with free delivery nothing much was expected.",negative

Ambience:- The cafe is situated just beside the road. But the ambience inside is completely different. The whole interior has been decorated with books, indoor games mostly & that's an excellent idea. The choice of music was good enough. The sitting arrangements were unique as well.

Food:- The food was pretty good. We had Alfredo pasta, BBQ pizza, one chicken starter, rice, ebony & ivory, tiramisu, Cappuccino and hookah.

Service:- They were serving fast enough & taking care of customers personally.

2251,Improvement on service is very much needed. It's a small food joint at maniktala with accommodation of around 16people. Food is decent for such a low price but the service is a joke. They have kept a little boy who is forgetful and very much new to his given role.the manager couldn't be found most of the times. Would forbade you to have salads as they are not freshly chopped. It can be an option but not at all a fancy restaurant you are looking for.,negative

Fortunately I stayed near this delivery outlet and ordered white sauce pasta and also sandwich to start with. The pasta was well sauteed in corns , onion, capsicum . The creamy texture and garnishing with cheese and corriander made it a beautiful and enticing to my appetite. The spices were apt to my taste buds and the packing was very well done. I also ordered aloo sandwich . The aloo was well mixed in spices to make it a delighted treat to my hunger. The bread was well cooked and crispy in taste.

Extremely bad quality of rice was used. Half cooked smell of rice was there. Even at a foot path stall you will get better than this cheap quality food.

5659,"Rannaghar, as beautiful as it sounds.

Rannaghar(kitchen) is the place from where the journey of a food start getting it's shape, it's the place where the flavours are given a name, a heart & so, does RANNAGHAR, PARK CIRCUS, justifies the name?

Oh yes it does, atleast to me.

Being a food blogger, ratings hardly matter to me.
I just indulge myself into various sections of our food industry to taste their offering & surprisingly, rannaghar is what I came across last week.
It's rated 3.6 but their quality of food justifies the maintenance of hygiene.

Ordered for their chicken kosha meal, thanks to Zomato for the WOW50.

It consisted of rice(fine quality), dal(could've been better) with fries, soyabean curry(was spicy and tantalizing) with the ultimate CHICKEN KOSHA-and for surprise, I received two leg pieces, thanks for that.
Tasted amazing.
Nothing overdone with perfect play of spices.

The overall experience was great, nice packaging.

Way to go RANNAGHAR.

What i disliked: service. We waited for 35 mins to get a seat and more 30 mins to get the food served although only soup. Because the staffs were busy attending the reserved section.

1.Our plates were being removed even before we were done with our food. 
2. No one was coming to clean the table after being repeatedly asked. 

The excuses were even more annoying.

This outlet is entirely veg. Disappointing. But the way it is prepared it actually quenches your thirst for non veg. In a way non veg gets replaced by veg.

I am a born foodie and I love to experiment different cuisines, The Coastal Macha is one such place which calls me again and again just because of the kind of food they serve and obviously the quality they have always maintained.  Coastal foods are way better and tastier than what we imagine, this place has my heart. My blog is based upon numerous visits I had to this place and each and every time I had an amazing experience.
The interiors are done in a very simple way, the lighting is done in an artistic way. Everything with decor and interior is just perfect, not overdone or underdone too. The Coastal Macha can accommodate 50-55 heads, space is huge inside.

Must try tandoori devilled crab, malabar paratha, mutton ghee roast and tender coconut pudding.

The best combination of all time & a perfect bliss for me.

So,
Mutton Biryani - The biryani was quite light, well balanced flavors , non oily and most importantly delicious. The mutton pieces were succulent too..it was worth it for me.

Chicken Chaap - meat was juicy, tender and perfectly coocked. This dish successfully satisfied my taste buds.

Overall highly recommend for everyone to try them out.

It even degrades during the times of Durga Puja.",negative

Basically they tried giving a beach feeling, however couldn't be exhibited well enough because of space crunch. A wide range of exquisite sea foods are available there. From octopus, crabs and squids, they have it all. The dishes tried were all satisfactory. The staffs are extremely courteous.

Shuru se shuru karte hai , the Chicken Reshmi and Hariyali Kebabs were soft and tasty and not chewy at all . The Chicken Tandoori priced at Rs.220 is phenomenal . The taste of it still lingers in my mouth as I write this .
The mains consisted of Mutton Rezala , Chicken Tikka Butter Masala , Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala , Dal Makhani and Breads . Except the Dal , I loved each and every dish mentioned above .
The Biryani was so good 😍😍 the mutton piece was succulent and tender . The rice had a nice aroma and isn't very heavy on the stomach .
Now , the desserts. Shahi Tukda 😍. Period . Gajar Ka halwa 😍. Period . Firni 😍. Period . Each of them were cherished and devoured till our hearts were satisfied 😂🔥

All in all a great place with great food . The rates are cheaper than other Mughlai restaurants in the area . Must Visit :)",positive

FOOD REVIEW - As the name suggests Mixed Seafood Soup was prepared with squid, octopus, cuttle fish and prawns. Soup was thick too.
Chicken Fritters was pretty good as starter recommendation, tosted with salsa sauce.
Maharani pulao paired with Mutton kasa was simply mesmerising and on the other hand Daab Chingri was simply bang on.
And the last certainly not the least, the Baked Rasgulla was the showstopper.

2268,"● Location: Purnadas Road, Hindustan Park
● Type: Online Delivery
● Cuisine: Chinese

We ordered-

*Korean Fried Rice: This special Fried rice has a mixture of both sweet and salty flavours. Soya Sauce seems to be the primary ingredient of the dish. The seasonings though strong, the vegetables and meats are nice, fresh and juicy. 
*Chicken Prawn Hakka Noodles: The prawns are big and juicy, the chicken is deep-fried and a bit chewy. A bit oily than usual, yet the noodles are thick and flavourful.
*Bhetki in Chilli sauce: Bhetki fish was encased in a thick batter of cornflour. The fish though fresh and succulent; could hardly be enjoyed due to the heavy covering. The Chilli sauce is not-so-hot and plain, which is most enjoyable for non-spicy eaters.

The food quality and quantity is sufficient for 3-4 people. The cost is reasonable too. Must try for a modified Chinese preparation.

Although it was pretty late we were able to get the dishes as per our liking. We ordered a full chicken tandoori , full punjabi chicken for starters. For main course, we had Laccha paratha, veg fried rice, chicken bharta and chicken do pyaja. As usual everything was tasty and pocket friendly. For everything we had it cost us Rs 838/-. A must visit place. But be aware of crowd since not too many tables are available.",positive

545,"The ambience was nice. I liked the decor! But the food was satisfactory. For appetisers we tried the Kokum Sea beach, Carribean one and virjin mojito. Each of them had a great taste!
Then for starters we ordered the Zakum kebabs. The kebabs weren't soft. It was a bit chewy. For the main course, we had Bamboo Biryani and Murgh Ghee Roast! The quantity of Bamboo Biryani was very satisfying. That's a plus point! The murgh ghee roast was a nice one. That's worth trying!

276,"One of those cloud kitchens which are too good with their quality food.Always.
Noteworthy mentions are Thakurbarir Chicken Pulao,Mutton Biryani and Chicken Chaap.
These are a must try here.
The gravy of the chaap was rightly balanced with soft baby chicken pieces. The mutton biryani on the other hand was delicious. The Mutton pieces were mostly boneless and insanely soft.
Definitely worth a try.
Packing of foods are also impressive.",positive

566,"The much-heard-about place! Yeah it did live up to my expectations but not beyond that. Courteous staffs and decent decor with a tribal touch to it! The foods were all good but the Banspora Chicken was the BEST! Its taste is so unique. The Prawns were tender, juicy and perfectly cooked with mild flavours. The Patropora Mutton was also juicy and tasty but it could have been cooked a little bit more. The Wild Red Rice tasted good and was a nice pair to the Banspora Chicken. The Malyasian Seafood Rice could have been given a bit more attention cause the taste was a bit off for me but still nice. And finally, the Squid was a also a Star; crisp on the outside and a bit chewy on the inside, the taste was quite to my liking! You can surely check this place out if you want to taste something different and out of the box.",positive

Food : We had Delhi 6 half tandoori chicken and makke ki roti with sarso ka saag. First one was served exceptionally quick.

Tandoori Chicken : Nicely marinated and cooked leg pieces were juicy and soft. It was served with pudina chutney and onion rings. 3.5/5

Makke ki roti : We chose this item from their Christmas special menu. Roti was saltier than usual. 2/5

Sarson ka saag : It was served with two cubes of jaggery and one cube of butter. Taste was moderate. 2.5/5

Note : The food they serve is not worth of the price they charge. Average food. Not going back again.",negative

They offere you cushion like sofa cum bed seating places where you can sit comfortabely and chat. The floor was covered by real grass. I if have to rate the ambience then this place deserves a perfect 5.
They also took special care of ambience and hygiene of that place.
Coming to food we ordered:
1. Butter Chicken masala
2. Mixed Noodles
3. Butter Nun
4. Chilli Chicken
5. Chilli Panneer
6. Tandori Roti
There was nothing very special about the food items. Moreover my trip over there was almost good and the food quality can be improved",negative

Their chicken lollipops are just perfect, the seasoning's on point, the chicken is so moist on the inside but crisp on the outside. Another one of their attractions is the cheese chicken roll which has cheese filled upto to the last bite. The quantity of food is also average and the ambience gives you a really great chinese experience. The pan fried chicken momos were extremely appetizing and a must try for all those foodies who are looking for a bit of heat.

Not only were we left unattended for hours but were also charged with arrogance on questioning them on their behaviour towards us. The owner has no sense of decency and decorum.
Anyway, considering the huge population our city has and the never ending demand for outside food, even a below mediocre place like this will continue to disappoint us for quite sometime.",negative

The items were packed very well and quantity was sufficient for 2. But i found the taste and quality of the fish dishes unremarkable.

According to me you can sit outside under the tree and Enjoy ur tea or snacks in an open air.
Active staffs I mean even if it's so busy they attend all their guest without any trouble.
This place don'nt need any Introduction as its among one of the places who serve Panjabi flavour in Kolkata .
Though my personal experience says this place is overrated and over priced because of being only Punjabi Dhaba in Town.

1781,"Fusion bangali food at its best ! 
This was our place for Nobomi lunch . 

The show stealer was the refreshing gondhoraj julep , a must! 
And the kancha aam er pie , DELISH. 

The starter was sausage in a cheesey dip the twist was the kari pata and rai phoron, sprinkled with bangali r priyo murmure aloor jhuri bhaja, where do you get these ideas @bohemia ? The prep might sound unbelievable, but do taste it to believe .

Maa ordered the pagla mamar biriyani, she was elated by the mutton pieces , she says they were melt in the mouth and the rice was flavoured with ‘paanch foron ‘ and made in butter I think , so very different. But a good choice .
The ghatshila chicken was spicy and hot! A great combination, the gravy was very flavourful. 

The Malpua cheesecake too was soft and had hint of malpua in it . 

Considering the Pujo rush it’s unbelievable the quality Bohemian maintained . Kudos !",positive
1980,"A very comfortable place to hang out. Food is good. Ambiance is appreciable. Courteous staffs. I've used the zomato gold offer.

2. Chicken Picata - This is a must try for spaghetti lovers and for the ones who love trying new dish.
3.Shisha - kiwi flavoured.

Like the name it gives a feel that the sitting is on a ship's deck. Sat on the open area. Ambience was charming. They have a closed area as well.

Ordered Seesha (double flovoured), a pint of beer, cheese garlic bread, non veg kabeeb platter & a cocktail. Taste wise all the items were good. Pocket pinch 2500 in round figure for the servings.

Place is highly recommended.",positive

I had Grilled chicken sandwich, Special Chicken Burger and KitKat Sundae. The sandwich was nice, especially the chicken filling inside. The Burger was awesome, it is huge at just ₹119. The Kit Kat Sundae is soul filling. I highly recommend this cafe if you care only about food and less about the ambiance.",positive
5565,"Biryani never ceases me drooling. And frankly speaking, sometimes even the taste does not matter. When I first saw this restaurant, one month ago I was so excited and made a visit within a week. This is a improvised joint serving Biriyani in a cafe type restaurant which is very useful for a 'sit and fill your tummy and go'.

Coming to the food, I have ordered biryani, of course. And it was beyond my expectation. Rice was super fine, perfectly mixed with spices. Two big chunks of chicken pieces were there. And the mighty 'potato', which a Bengali will never compromise with, was really well-cooked and soft. It was served with a small bowl filled with raita and ring onions.

Here to mention that there are options for personalizing your order like adding one chicken piece or two pieces of potato etc, which are totally unique and first-time for me.

Service is quick. Staffs are amiable. The ambience is perfect for a grab-n-go meal.",positive
4234,"A well decorated cozy restro which we hoped inti after some busy college schedule.

They have both ac and non ac dining, we opted for the ac one which was on first floor. The ambience is nothing so great though, but it's quite comfortable. We ordered 2 chicken biriyanis and 1 mutton biriyani with a plate of green salad. The biriyani was really good with soft and succulent chicken and mutton pieces. Though there was no egg, the quantity was good enough for a single person. They also served complimentary raita with the biriyanis.

The service was good and fast, the boy who served us was very amiable. The gst was included in the menu, no extras charged. Overall it was a very good experience. A place you should visit, if you are in Esplande area. Recommended.",positive

For an example for just two pieces extremely small posto Bora they charge you Rs 75.

The staff are decent and place is very comfortable and very good for lunching and dinning out with friends and family.
When you visit here please do try the paneer butter tikka masala which is their speciality and also Handi panner which is my favourite. I always get some kulchas specially amritsar kulcha to go with this delicious food they serve.
I think everyone must try, whether vegetarian or non vegetarian, once in a while one must try vegetarian food as well.
People always say that non veg is best and are fond of eating chicken and mutton.
I am from the same category but the day i visited the place I started loving vegetarian food as well and started recommending it to others as well as the place is great and the food served is excellent, no doubt and the service they provide is impeccably good and great.

What was lacking was the fact that I ordered for cheese burst crust and alas the cheese would not burst only. Just a minute spread of cheese between the crusts.

Definitely an overhyped eatery.

The taste of the soup was good. But the quantity was small. The lemon crispy chicken was fried way too much and was having almost biscuit like consistency which I was not in agreement with. The pepper salt mushroom was again a tad too much fried. The rest of the items were at best okay. The portion size is meagre though especially for the starters.

Quantity to food in lasagnia was more that enough but I felt the quantity was less in mutton roast and lamb steak compare to the price they are charging for it.

Even though a vivid pizza lover I Ordered the potato twister (Tandooori Flavor) I was a bit nervous this time coz who eats potato outside. But they changed my view, this potato should be tasted. Really liked the flavor a lot and how it was presented. Kudos to the makers.
Then I had to try the pasta returned in the evening to try the pasta . I thank myself for doing it.

I would recommend it to everyone. Just try it once and if you don't want to visit it again I would take it all back.",positive

I took a delivery from this restaurant, and it was miserable... After my very bad review, they called me up, and apologized... And as everyone deserves a 2nd chance, i took their offer of trying their food again...
And i must say... I wasn't at all disappointed.
The taste of their biriyani is a bit different that is served in kolkata, but it's one of a kind.
And their hospitality is really good.
Hope to be back soon.
But they should control their quality, so that not even a customer is served with bad food.
Hope to visit soon!",positive

A fun decor but certainly not good for photography as the lighting is very dim. Gives you dhaba vibes. We went there for chilling and had beer with tandoori chicken.The tandoori chicken was simply rustic and yum!!!!

Baked cheese cake

Taste:
1st of all they plate their dishes very beautifully.
The taste of every dish did justice.
The grilled chicken in that cheedy mushroom sauce was heavenly.
The ham and cheese bliny was a new try and tasted pretty different and nice but i was there was a little more cheese in it.
The hot chickes were finger licking good.
Icy spicy was a soda based drink.Spicey sweet citrusy.Yummy!!
The cheese cake is one of the best cheese cake i ever tried.It was so smooth the texture felt real nice and the plating was so outstanding.

Highly recommended.I loved my time there.",positive

Kashmiri pulao - loved all the fruits and paneer they have added to make this item more luscious.

Ghost zafrani korma - the gravy was wellmade with perfectly cooked mutton.

Pan fried chicken gravy noodles - this was a stunner, and not many places do justice to this preparation.

Blueberry firni - a unique combination of firni and blueberry but the sweetness was nicely balanced.

Classic virgin mojito - a drink that goes with all sort of palates.

Location - a few steps from Hazra more, behind Keya Seth's mall

Once inside, the surroundings are cramped. All these are compensated by the food though. Ordered the 555 Thali. The welcome drink, Lebu Lonka was appreciable. The starters and the main course were served simultaneously, which is a bit surprising. All the items were superbly and freshly cooked. Although several items could be repeated as part of the deal, the first serving was so substantial that one doesn't really needs to repeat anything. Of special mention is the prawn malai curry, the mutton curry, the fish cutlet and the chicken paturi.

Kudos to the management for their superb fare at very reasonable rates. Coupled with cooperative and gentle staff. I wish Saptapadi every success in the coming days.",positive

But it's still the only decent go-to option considering the locale. The staffs are friendly and the decor is simple yet elegant.
The quantity of any dish of Have More is to swear by. Even a plate of momo can become your dinner, as it comes with 8 huge pieces and a large bowl of broth.
Tandooris are quite good, though the meat can be a little more tender.
The Chinese side dishes are a disappointment, as all of them taste more or less the same, albeit with minor variations. It's better to stick to all the Indian dishes and just noodles.",positive

First of all the place is just opposite to Gitanjali Metro Station, if you come from garia bus stand you may walk for that for enjoying afternoon. And very close from Naktala Udyan Sangha you may visit here at the time of pujo hopping.

Secondly, The ambience is looking nice. The staff behavior is so good. Service is perfectly all right. We ordered A King Size Coffee, one Egg Wrap and a combo of A cup of coffee and Chiken Wrap.

Last but not the least....The tatse of food is just awesome. Personally I don't like the Egg Wrap and that is just waste of money...Yea it is true CCD is few costly it is not in poket pinch.

5185,"What better way to start your lazy Sunday mornings, than with this special coffee at Hotel Homely Raj or Raj restaurant as it is popularly known in the Locality. Known for it famous dosas and other south Indian delicacies, this place is usually crowded during the breakfast hours. 
Considering the sizes of the dosas, i'd say get 1 dosa for two people, if you do not want to start your day with a really heavy stomach. I visited with my family and got the cheese masala dosa, plain masala dosa and the puri. But highlight of the breakfast was this coffe at the end. It is advertised in their indoor screen as ""Dancing Coffee"" because u can see the swirling milk interact with the dark coffee beneath. But beware, it is twice the normal shot of a coffee. So it is better split between two people. And look out for the milk foam on the top, scoop it up and try to taste with your tongue. 

P.S. it was my papa's recommendation. I didn't expect this to be such a good experience.",positive

Its surprising to see such taste, ingredients, menu and quality in such a small roadside restaurant. The thukpa, Momo, shayfaley, noodles, are exceptional. The use bhetki and decent size prawns in their preparations. Definitely a thumbs up for this place. ❤️",positive
272,"I’m so glad We’ve chosen this place to celebrate our second year of registry marriage. We came through this place via Zomato. It had am offer which included a bottle of wine and added 30% off on the ala carte menu.
There’s nothing much to describe about the ambiance. It’s inspired from London’s 10 Downing Street. Very classy indeed.
Coming to food we went for their Chinese platter which had chilli fish, chicken wings, fried wanton and dry chilli chicken. All of them tasted equally amazing. We ordered peri peri baby corn too. It came with lip smacking mayonnaise. Batter was light and airy and the corn was cooked really well. We went for a Long Island ice tea also which shook me to be honest. After that I was literally flying.
Giving 5 to any place is really a big deal for me it’d have been a four, however they surprised us with a fried ice cream with a magic candle on it. I loved that touch. Amazing place worth of more visits.",positive

Now the burrito was entirely the opposite as it kept falling apart. The filling was A1 , though the quantity of chicken seemed less but flavour wise was great. Hope they would make better burrito wraps in the future.",negative
3066,"Kolkata doesn't have much to offer when it comes to authentic south indian food. There are very few outlets serving south indian out of which one is jyoti vihar in camac street, near to American embassy.
Their ambience is nice and located at a quite and calm area. A good place to visit with freinds or family based on ambience.
Coming to food, first of all they have very less options in all the varieties. You dont have much to choose. We were in a group of 6 people hence got a chance to try most of the items from their offered menu. Dosas are okay, not good not bad. The taste is average. Sambhar is nice but their coconut chatni can be made much better. Vada is much below average. We had ordered only two vadas for 6 people yet that was difficult to finish. Idli is fine again, not good, not bad. We ended with filter coffee which was good both in quantity and quality wise. Overall our experience in food was not upto the mark.

Mughlai Paratha (2.5/5) :
---------------------------------------------------
Paratha was delivered in plastic container with rich red potato curry in foil pack. Potato curry tasted very very tangy. Mughlai pieces was big and fully stuffed. But it felt bit soggy and felt like it was fried way before placing the order. Inside stuffing was absolutely dry & hard that made it taste very odd.

Their pricing is pretty cheap, for that compromise done in food quality is totally seen. Still it is good option if you want to get filling food for cheap price.",negative

The biryani, chicken dishes are now lacking that taste.

May be the chef is changed or simply they are not planning to keep their taste same.

I hope they improve because their food was too good.

My personal favorite is their King fish steak and also the pork belly. Both are filling and sufficient for one person. My daughter loves their Carbonara. We also have tried their buffet which is a must-have considering the price and the offerings. The homemade Coconut ice cream is another must-have.

The food is mostly Bengali with a few continental dishes thrown in. Service is good, just call in the boys with a ring of the ghanta 😋. Nobody can disturb you from having a peaceful conversation with your friends and enjoy some finger food or maybe you would enjoy a full Bengali style meal. The food was good.

2735,"- This is the best vegetarian restaurant in Kolkata. They serve pure vegetarian food without onion and garlic. The ambience is very nice, calm with amazing old architecture. We tried veg pulao, paneer tandoori, naan, paneer butter masala. All the items were very good. Vegetarian pulao quantity was enough for two. Price is bit more. The service can be better. Otherwise ambience, food quality was very nice. They also sell Bengali sweets, snacks at the outside of the restaurant. The car parking space is quite big so, do not worry about parking.

Vegetarian pulao was very rich. It made with sallow fried vegetables, and served with cashew nuts, raisins on top of it. 

 Paneer butter masala was creamy. It’s almost melt in your mouth  

Paneer tandoori was ok, need more masla. It should have been marinated longer.",positive

We ordered chocolate milkshake which was okayish and cheap.  This cafe is idle for friends to gather and gossip in the afternoon as it does mot cost much money. 
Cheese toast which we ordered was delicious, but was disappointed as nonveg snack options were less compared to veg . Overall a I give them a 3 star.",negative

2933,"I have ordered twice from this place. Their packaging is good and the quality of food is very good too. Meats may not always be fresh but the fish needs to be fresh. And the bhoj company serves good fresh fish which i was really happy about. The first time i had ordered bhetki paturi and chittol machher muitha. Both were tasty and full of flavour. However i felt the bhetki was a bit pricey.

The second time i ordered dhokar dalna, mutton kosha and chingri malaikari. The dhokar dalna and mutton had adequate quantity but the malaikari was again a bit pricey. But the quality of them all was very good and a bit sweet for my taste. Looking forward to order more items from here.",positive

My bestie and I had preferred sitting indoors, for the want of some cool air. The place has some interesting wall art and don't miss the ceiling. The bookshelves have some of the best books for the bibliophiles as you order the food. We had ordered for potato cheese balls, and they were the best! I have to say that the service is slow. We went on to order the pasta in white sauce. Food was great! My friend had also ordered a takeaway from there. She was also impressed! Looking forward to go there again!",positive

This place mainly provides North Indian Dishes and has two types of seating arrangement i e, 6 seater tables on one side and 2-4 seater tables on the other side behind Curtains. The food quality is good and quantity is ""sufficient"" compared to its pocket friendly prices. They don't take much time to provide food after its being ordered.

Tandoori Roti- 4/5
Butter Roti- 4.5/5
Chicken Do Piyaza- 5/5
Mutton Kassa- 4.5/5

Pocket pinch: 60 INR
Special mention: the food was packaged very nicely. There was no spill at all. They even provide a plastic container for the tea.

Now my question is since chicken is white meat it can change into any colour but red but properly cooked !! To confirm my doubt I verified with the friend accompanying me who as well agreed to my point ! Anyway I have always hated this place and if time and distance had not been an issue, I would have never liked to visit this joint again and will try my not to do so to the best of my ability !",negative

Coming to the food, the non veg chelo has four and the veg has three kinds of kebabs. The food is reasonably good, the drinks are welcomingly cheap.

It feels good to be here. They take you down the memory lane.

We orderd 'Double chicken combo',(here you get 4 pieces sandwich/2 pieces burger, 2 chicken fry, french fries, 2 crunchy chicken fry leg piece, & coke) & chicken popcorn.
In combo they provide many dishes in moderate price but each & everything is just worst to taste.
It was so worse that we could not eat the whole thing, we had to throw it in the dustbin.

We Ordered -
Cappuccino And Chicken Pasta In White Sauce.

The Cappuccino was served with two biscuits also, and that gained our attention because hardly any cafe provides biscuits anymore with tea/coffee.

The Chicken pasta was enough for two but I guess, the salt was less. Though, the sauce was blended well so it tasted good enough.

This place is pathetic and also they overcharge for everything on their menu.Some items were even more expensive than, some reputed cafe in town.
My friend and I had settled for a cup of chocolate-coffee each after scanning the whole menu.The coffee seemed great to the eyes ,but did not taste good at all. Don't even get close to the space if you have hygiene concerns.
Or rather stay away at any cost and save yourself from a truck load of regret and wasting some money.

Absolutely loved the cold coffee and pepperoni pizza but the fish n chips was a huge disappointment. It was basically a beer batter fried fish instead of the classic fish n chips I love and come to understand from the name. Also the amount of beer is so much in the dish that the smell and bitterness of the beer overpowers the taste of the fish. The only edible part of this dish were the potato wedges.

992,"Zucca is an amazing place to hangout with your special someone sitting on the rooftop and chilling....
I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and had an awesome time.
We sat downstairs first and then when the rain stopped we were shifted to the rooftop.So basically got an idea of both their seating arrangements.
We ordered Blue lagoon, spaghetti in white sauce,fish n chips, Amritsari Fish,and Afghani chicken.
The drink is my all time favorite.
The pasta was delicious but lacked the right amount of seasoning..but with a little bit of oregano and chilli flakes on top...it was just right.
The kababs were simply lipsmacking!!!We enjoyed it with two cans of Ginger Ale. Recommended.
The fish and chips were decent.
The ambience is better on the rooftop.The downstairs one isn't appealing.
The service was great!

9798,"ordered quite a lot of times from this outlet ,
this is quite an economical place to order food from so here are the items which i ordered -
1. Fried Momos - The filling was good , everything about it was good apart from the fact that it was not crunchy and it got soggy by the time it came to me , even there was way too much oil dripping along , please check that .

2. Fish Fingers - very strategically priced 4 for 80 , the taste is nice..

3. Mutton Chop - One of the items which i liked the most.. mutton chop was very nice and flavourful

4. Special Mughlai Parantha - It ruined everything , everything about it was bad , it was too oily , it was too salty , the filling was not tasty , the alu sabji which accompanied was not tasty either .

since this outlet is quite ecomonical and serves good food though they goof up sometime but thats Okay , do check it and you would be fantastic so a 4 **** .",positive

Packaging was ok and overall the Biryani felt average.",negative

Quantity was although good enough but for quality it was very oily, almost dipped in oil which was a big disappointment.
Another thing I ordered was chicken changezi which is generally a gravy dish but they sent me some chicken pakora which I was stunned on.

3992,"Went here during the pujas. We ordered brownie shake and green apple mohito. I really don't know if it was for the puja rush or something else, the brownie shake sucked. It felt like I was having chocolate shake and there was no brownie in it. They just gave some brownie which I felt were just plain chocolate cake for garnishing at the top. I was disappointed and pissed because they charged 180 rupees and gave this. The green appple mohito was still okay. But I have had much better green apple mohito n brownie shakes at other cafes which I can name as well.

The interior is good. It's a cozy place n is decorated nicely. The space is utilised properly.

If it's just for the Pujo time then I can excuse there lacking, but not visiting here again.

A note of advice for the cafe is that if you are charging such a huge amount then make sure you provide food of that level because I have had these in other places and trust me, they tasted much much better n are much lesser in price.",negative

Faced with a menu with sushi 🍣 on it, something I never had, I went ahead and ordered fish, crab🦀, and prawn. While it wasn't lipsmackingly delicious, it was pleasantly different.

2293,"Firstly, this rating is solely given on the basis of buffet spread on a particular day. The ambience and service is not questioned. I don't know about ala carte menu.

There were two types of soup (1 veg, 1 non veg), four types of starters (2 veg, 2 non veg), six types of main course ( noodles, rice, 2 types of veg gravy, chicken and fish items), typical desserts (brownie, darshan, 3types of icecream).

The spread looks fine within the price range but what is disappointing is the repetitive taste. The gravy of all the main course items tastes similar with slight altercation which does not surprise your taste buds. After one time you do not feel like eating anything new and everything gets bland. I felt the spread was over hyped to be honest. But I really do want to visit again for their ala carte menu. I hope I'll not be disappointed.",negative

Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its spread of confectioneries and desserts.

Our beverages rolled into something fun were the alcohol containing gola s of Kala khatta and lime flavor.
The corn was like perfect to taste followed by the yummy parathas, the yummiest of them was the pudina one which was almost like a naan. The Malabar paratha was like layer by layer of ghee and pretty heavy to eat. The paneer dish was sufficient for 3 of us.

I ordered two chicken biryani.But after 30mins when nobody from Zomato picked up my order I called to the restaurant.The worker who very politely told me that delivery boys are on strike so no one is picking up my order. No my point is if delivery boys are not available why did zomato enable the delivery option? When I tried to cancel my order through the chat they were saying u should know we can't cancel the order. Ok that's fine. But neither zomato delivering it to me nor cancelling it.Then what should I do?
Although the restaurant itself rejected the order.And thanks for that.

For the food and behaviour the restaurant gets 5 points.
But Zomato app gets -5 points. I would never ever order anything through zomato.Because this is d 2nd time I had faced problems regarding the delivery.

4638,A Highway Bangali Restuarant . Prices are pretty fine. Staff are very friendly to the customers . Its very famous for its Insian snacks like tandoori chicken which makes very popular .The food is casual But their signature dish is lobster which is not found commonly in other Bengali restaurants so Allover its an average restaurant along the airport.... thank you,negative
8329,"I ordered here through Zomato delivery. The food reached well within time. Nowadays fried chicken outlets are in every corner, but most of them are below average if you keep them at par with KFC. But the food from here was way better than those from other outlets. Here i found the chicken to be perfectly crispy and the chicken was with skin (Which is very important when you are making fried chicken).

Two cons are -

1. Chickens were a bit too spicy (as in more use of cayenne or red chilli)

2. A bit over fried.

That's all folks, until next time.. :)",positive

1640,Great place. Loved the Ambience. It was quite soothing. Worth going. The place has a bit problem with parking because the lane is Crowded with other cafes and restaurants. They have a good quantity and price is also decent.,positive

4359,"For a totally different Indian Rajasthani cuisine, it’s the best place ever.. 

For the taste n quality of food it’s nice but for service part they are not very prompt.. 

We had ordered daal baati platter, sattu paratha platter, plain kadai daal and mix veg ..  for baati it is supposed to be crisp n hot but it wasn’t much like that but ya taste was good so u can definitely have it.. I like the mix veg a lot.. I could eat it aise hi without anything.. sattu paratha n aloo paratha were good.. 

If u r a Indian freak go n have but beware of services..",positive
2936,"A good place to rest legs after lots of shopping in new market.it was crowded when we entered at noon.the indoor was Nice very minimalistic approcah nothing fancy. We ordered rice,mutton kosha, kochu pata diye chingri ,muger dal.i loved the chingri and the chicken ,the dal was tasty too. I loved the way they prepared the banglai dishes.mostly people from bangladesh came to eat here.but this place is also famous among Indians too .Service was a little bit slow.but the price was cheap and taste was good.",positive
9372,"I tried the khichdi combo. It contained a portion of khichdi, chokha, pickle and a cup of hot lemon tea. I feel the quantity of khichdi could be increased. So much chokha wasn't needed. Instead, a papad would be very welcoming in this combo. The tea was hot and well prepared. Packaging was good and prices are quite reasonable.",negative
2455,"Gave it a visit this panchami 2018, tried their mutton biryani ,chicken do piyaza and green salad..
They serve huge quantity of biryani enough to fill stomach of two person..biryani comes with just one piece mutton and one piece alu..expected an egg at the price of ₹175!
Chicken dopiyaza was average in taste wih 4 pieces of chicken the chicken were not very fleshy msotly bony!
The biryani was served cold to us which is the most disappointing thing!asked them even to warm up the food but they again served the same dish !management is poor they kept us waiting for long and served the same food again!very disappointing!",negative
592,I find their biriyani little dry compare to arsalan an aminia's biriyani... It is good for the people who loves light biriyanis... Their rezala was too good... Overall good experience....,positive
177,"One of the heritage hotels of Kolkata. The ambience upholds its true spirit. The food, ambience, staff, decor everything is amazing. Special mention - original chicken garlic steak and chicken tetrazzini. Chicken tetrazzini is also its heritage dish and a favourite among cheese lovers.",positive
1430,"I walked into the restaurant with my colleague for lunch. I was expecting something fancy with the way they had projected it from outside the gate. Here is my review

Food ordered: A Mysore dosa for my friend and a South Indian thali for me. The thali was quite wholesome (pic attached). The quantity was just enough to fill the stomach without making me feel heavy at all. The dosa was crisp and well cooked and the sabji inside was delicious.

Quality of food: 5/5
Value for money: 4/5 ( it's not expensive but prices could be a little lower)
Courtesy of staff: 5/5 (They were really helpful and served us a complimentary bowl of kesari for dessert)
Ambiance: 4/5 ( really spacious and comfortable, they could change the playlist to more traditional numbers from the south..)

Overall: 5/5",positive
5876,"Amazing job there. The service is prompt. Ordered orange phucka and corn chatizza. orange phucka was 6 in number , had enough filling neatly packed in zip pouch. The orange flavored water was a stand out. The Corn chatizza was amazingly innovative and yummy.",positive

3404,"Situated at just opposite or Golpark Ccd, it's a small eatery with a max sitting capacity of 6persons at a time, so its better to avail a take away or order online. I am a momo fanatic nd i have tried momos from famous eateries all around but truly their momos r super tasty nd totally different with a unique taste accompanied with their special momo sauce. U can have any of them without giving a second thought. After momos they have a second specialty ""shekwa"" chinese style barbeque meat ... U shld definitely try those according to ur meat choice but if u love pork never miss that its a must have nd generally its available after 5pm.",positive
7737,it's one & only restaurant in this area.. food quality & quantity is ok.. been there 2-3times as it is nearest to my place.. service was slow everytime.. ambiance is ok..,negative
10414,"Went there after choturthi hopping. Too tiny Chinese joint this is. At a time they can arrange seats for 8 people. But the food was so good in aspect of quality and quantity.

We tried -

1. Chicken fried rice - comes in a good quantity. Taste is good.

2. Egg gravy noodles - a bit heavier as it has gravy on its topping. Good in taste.

3. Sweet and sour chicken - they serve 10 pieces of it. Nice as per pricing.

The pricing is damn pocket friendly. Worth the try.",positive
1089,My favourite. One of best family restaurants in town. And of course food needs no statement. North Indian Khana hai agar park Street me toh BSS hi jaao. Sahi hai wo.,positive
317,"Royal Indian Hotel famous for its Mutton Chaap & Mutton Biryani in the city.
The decoration and ambience is pretty simple but will give you the feeling of a Royal place.
Recently visited the place after years and tried their Rumali Roti and Mutton Chaap.
Mutton Chaap is cooked over charcoal flame for hours which adds a smoky flavour to the dish. As sooon as you take a bite of succulent mutton pieces, it just melts in the mouth. ❤️ Strongly Recommended.

Everyone must visit the place.",positive
6384,"To be really honest if you are literally broke but being a biriyani lover looking to have biriyani within 100 rupees this is the place! Just make sure you don't go inside. Take your packet from outside, go home and enjoy.  P.S: Even if you have 60 rupees you can still have "" Egg biriyani"" ;)",negative
4514,Had their Mixed rice chicken combo and previously experienced their Chicken manchurian and chicken fried rice. Previous experience was good but last experience with combo was not satisfactory. The mixed rice and chilly chicken was okayish type but they provided 4pieces of chicken pakoda though it was supposed to be one piece of fish finger and 2pieces of pakoda. Dont know why this happened. The prices were in the lower range.,negative
